    "abstract": "We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.",

    "abstract": "Articulated object manipulation remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the complex kinematic constraints and the limited physical reasoning of existing methods. In this work, we introduce ArtGS, a novel framework that extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by integrating visual-physical modeling for articulated object understanding and interaction. ArtGS begins with multi-view RGB-D reconstruction, followed by reasoning with a vision-language model (VLM) to extract semantic and structural information, particularly the articulated bones. Through dynamic, differentiable 3DGS-based rendering, ArtGS optimizes the parameters of the articulated bones, ensuring physically consistent motion constraints and enhancing the manipulation policy. By leveraging dynamic Gaussian splatting, cross-embodiment adaptability, and closed-loop optimization, ArtGS establishes a new framework for efficient, scalable, and generalizable articulated object modeling and manipulation. Experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that ArtGS significantly outperforms previous methods in joint estimation accuracy and manipulation success rates across a variety of articulated objects.

    "abstract": "Due to the complex and highly dynamic motions in the real world, synthesizing dynamic videos from multi-view inputs for arbitrary viewpoints is challenging. Previous works based on neural radiance field or 3D Gaussian splatting are limited to modeling fine-scale motion, greatly restricting their application. In this paper, we introduce LocalDyGS, which consists of two parts to adapt our method to both large-scale and fine-scale motion scenes: 1) We decompose a complex dynamic scene into streamlined local spaces defined by seeds, enabling global modeling by capturing motion within each local space. 2) We decouple static and dynamic features for local space motion modeling. A static feature shared across time steps captures static information, while a dynamic residual field provides time-specific features. These are combined and decoded to generate Temporal Gaussians, modeling motion within each local space. As a result, we propose a novel dynamic scene reconstruction framework to model highly dynamic real-world scenes more realistically. Our method not only demonstrates competitive performance on various fine-scale datasets compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, but also represents the first attempt to model larger and more complex highly dynamic scenes.

    "abstract": "Physical adversarial attack methods expose the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks and pose a significant threat to safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving. Camouflage-based physical attack is a more promising approach compared to the patch-based attack, offering stronger adversarial effectiveness in complex physical environments. However, most prior work relies on mesh priors of the target object and virtual environments constructed by simulators, which are time-consuming to obtain and inevitably differ from the real world. Moreover, due to the limitations of the backgrounds in training images, previous methods often fail to produce multi-view robust adversarial camouflage and tend to fall into sub-optimal solutions. Due to these reasons, prior work lacks adversarial effectiveness and robustness across diverse viewpoints and physical environments. We propose a physical attack framework based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), named PGA, which provides rapid and precise reconstruction with few images, along with photo-realistic rendering capabilities. Our framework further enhances cross-view robustness and adversarial effectiveness by preventing mutual and self-occlusion among Gaussians and employing a min-max optimization approach that adjusts the imaging background of each viewpoint, helping the algorithm filter out non-robust adversarial features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and superiority of PGA. Our code is available at:https://github.com/TRLou/PGA.",

Given an open-vocabulary search instruction (e.g., \"find a person\"), VISTA enables a robot to explore its environment to search for the object of interest, while simultaneously building a real-time semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of the scene. The robot navigates its environment by planning receding-horizon trajectories that prioritize semantic similarity to the query and exploration of unseen regions of the environment. To evaluate trajectories, VISTA introduces a novel, efficient viewpoint-semantic coverage metric that quantifies both the geometric view diversity and task relevance in the 3D scene. On static datasets, our coverage metric outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, FisherRF and Bayes' Rays, in computation speed and reconstruction quality. In quadrotor hardware experiments, VISTA achieves 6x higher success rates in challenging maps, compared to baseline methods, while matching baseline performance in less challenging maps. Lastly, we show that VISTA is platform-agnostic by deploying it on a quadrotor drone and a Spot quadruped robot. Open-source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a high-performance technique for novel view synthesis, enabling real-time rendering and high-quality reconstruction of small scenes. However, scaling to larger environments has so far relied on partitioning the scene into chunks -- a strategy that introduces artifacts at chunk boundaries, complicates training across varying scales, and is poorly suited to unstructured scenarios such as city-scale flyovers combined with street-level views. Moreover, rendering remains fundamentally limited by GPU memory, as all visible chunks must reside in VRAM simultaneously. We introduce A LoD of Gaussians, a framework for training and rendering ultra-large-scale Gaussian scenes on a single consumer-grade GPU -- without partitioning. Our method stores the full scene out-of-core (e.g., in CPU memory) and trains a Level-of-Detail (LoD) representation directly, dynamically streaming only the relevant Gaussians. A hybrid data structure combining Gaussian hierarchies with Sequential Point Trees enables efficient, view-dependent LoD selection, while a lightweight caching and view scheduling system exploits temporal coherence to support real-time streaming and rendering. Together, these innovations enable seamless multi-scale reconstruction and interactive visualization of complex scenes -- from broad aerial views to fine-grained ground-level details.",

By decoupling the lifting problem (converting an image to a 3D model representing what is visible) from the completion problem (hallucinating content not present in the input), we create a more deterministic task suitable for discriminative models. Our method employs visibility masks derived from optimized 3D Gaussian splats to exclude areas not visible from the source view during training. This masked training strategy significantly improves reconstruction quality in visible regions compared to strong baselines. Notably, despite being trained only on masked regions, Image2GS remains competitive with state-of-the-art discriminative models trained on full target images when evaluated on complete scenes.

Current methods show strong dependence on object detectors, introducing processing bottlenecks and limitations in taxonomic flexibility. To address these limitations, we propose a scene-centric 3D VLM for 3D Gaussian splat scenes that employs language- and task-aware scene representations. Our approach directly embeds rich linguistic features into the 3D scene representation by associating language with each Gaussian primitive, achieving early modality alignment. To process the resulting dense representations, we introduce a dual sparsifier that distills them into compact, task-relevant tokens via task-guided and location-guided pathways, producing sparse, task-aware global and local scene tokens. Notably, we present the first Gaussian splatting-based VLM, leveraging photorealistic 3D representations derived from standard RGB images, demonstrating strong generalization: it improves performance of prior 3D VLM five folds, in out-of-the-domain settings.",

Existing approaches primarily rely on low-pass filtering to mitigate aliasing. However, these methods are not sensitive to the sampling rate, often resulting in under-filtering and over-smoothing renderings. To address this limitation, we propose LOD-GS, a Level-of-Detail-sensitive filtering framework for Gaussian Splatting, which dynamically predicts the optimal filtering strength for each 3D Gaussian primitive. Specifically, we introduce a set of basis functions to each Gaussian, which take the sampling rate as input to model appearance variations, enabling sampling-rate-sensitive filtering. These basis function parameters are jointly optimized with the 3D Gaussian in an end-to-end manner. The sampling rate is influenced by both focal length and camera distance. However, existing methods and datasets rely solely on down-sampling to simulate focal length changes for anti-aliasing evaluation, overlooking the impact of camera distance. To enable a more comprehensive assessment, we introduce a new synthetic dataset featuring objects rendered at varying camera distances. Extensive experiments on both public datasets and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA rendering quality while effectively eliminating aliasing.

However, 3DGS heavily depends on accurate initialization and faces difficulties in optimizing unstructured Gaussian distributions into ordered surfaces, with limited adaptive density control mechanism proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a geometry-guided initialization to predict Gaussian parameters, ensuring precise placement and faster convergence. We then introduce a surface-aligned optimization strategy to refine Gaussian placement, improving geometric accuracy and aligning with the surface normals of the scene. Finally, we present a dynamic adaptive density control mechanism that adjusts Gaussian density based on regional complexity, for visual fidelity.

Current approaches extract the surface through costly post-processing steps, resulting in the loss of fine geometric details or requiring significant time and leading to very dense meshes with millions of vertices. More fundamentally, the a posteriori conversion from a volumetric to a surface representation limits the ability of the final mesh to preserve all geometric structures captured during training. We present MILo, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that bridges the gap between volumetric and surface representations by differentiably extracting a mesh from the 3D Gaussians. We design a fully differentiable procedure that constructs the mesh-including both vertex locations and connectivity-at every iteration directly from the parameters of the Gaussians, which are the only quantities optimized during training. Our method introduces three key technical contributions: a bidirectional consistency framework ensuring both representations-Gaussians and the extracted mesh-capture the same underlying geometry during training; an adaptive mesh extraction process performed at each training iteration, which uses Gaussians as differentiable pivots for Delaunay triangulation; a novel method for computing signed distance values from the 3D Gaussians that enables precise surface extraction while avoiding geometric erosion. Our approach can reconstruct complete scenes, including backgrounds, with state-of-the-art quality while requiring an order of magnitude fewer mesh vertices than previous methods. Due to their light weight and empty interior, our meshes are well suited for downstream applications such as physics simulations or animation.",

The model are then used to render each stabilized frame. We utilize a scene extrapolation module to avoid frame cropping.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful alternative to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), excelling in complex scene reconstruction and efficient rendering. However, it relies on high-quality point clouds from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), limiting its applicability. SfM also fails in texture-deficient or constrained-view scenarios, causing severe degradation in 3DGS reconstruction. To address this limitation, we propose AttentionGS, a novel framework that eliminates the dependency on high-quality initial point clouds by leveraging structural attention for direct 3D reconstruction from randomly initialization. In the early training stage, we introduce geometric attention to rapidly recover the global scene structure. As training progresses, we incorporate texture attention to refine fine-grained details and enhance rendering quality. Furthermore, we employ opacity-weighted gradients to guide Gaussian densification, leading to improved surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AttentionGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where point cloud initialization is unreliable. Our approach paves the way for more robust and flexible 3D Gaussian Splatting in real-world applications.",

GaussianImage recently pioneered the use of Gaussian Splatting to mitigate this cost, however, the slow training process limits its practicality, and the fixed number of Gaussians per image limits its adaptability to varying information entropy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a generalizable and self-adaptive image representation framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting. Our method employs a network to quickly generate a coarse Gaussian representation, followed by minimal fine-tuning steps, achieving comparable rendering quality of GaussianImage while significantly reducing training time. Moreover, our approach dynamically adjusts the number of Gaussian points based on image complexity to further enhance flexibility and efficiency in practice. Experiments on DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our method matches or exceeds GaussianImage's rendering performance with far fewer iterations and shorter training times. Specifically, our method reduces the training time by up to one order of magnitude while achieving superior rendering performance with the same number of Gaussians.",

We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices.

The recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques and their variants, 4DGS, achieve high-quality renderings of dynamic surgical scenes in real-time. However, 3D-GS-based methods still struggle in scenarios with varying illumination, such as low light and over-exposure. Training 3D-GS in such extreme light conditions leads to severe optimization problems and devastating rendering quality. To address these challenges, we present Endo-4DGX, a novel reconstruction method with illumination-adaptive Gaussian Splatting designed specifically for endoscopic scenes with uneven lighting. By incorporating illumination embeddings, our method effectively models view-dependent brightness variations. We introduce a region-aware enhancement module to model the sub-area lightness at the Gaussian level and a spatial-aware adjustment module to learn the view-consistent brightness adjustment. With the illumination adaptive design, Endo-4DGX achieves superior rendering performance under both low-light and over-exposure conditions while maintaining geometric accuracy. Additionally, we employ an exposure control loss to restore the appearance from adverse exposure to the normal level for illumination-adaptive optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that Endo-4DGX significantly outperforms combinations of state-of-the-art reconstruction and restoration methods in challenging lighting environments, underscoring its potential to advance robot-assisted surgical applications.

However, the heavy reliance of existing systems on photometric rendering loss for camera tracking undermines their robustness, especially in unbounded outdoor environments with severe viewpoint and illumination changes. To address these challenges, we propose TVG-SLAM, a robust RGB-only 3DGS SLAM system that leverages a novel tri-view geometry paradigm to ensure consistent tracking and high-quality mapping. We introduce a dense tri-view matching module that aggregates reliable pairwise correspondences into consistent tri-view matches, forming robust geometric constraints across frames. For tracking, we propose Hybrid Geometric Constraints, which leverage tri-view matches to construct complementary geometric cues alongside photometric loss, ensuring accurate and stable pose estimation even under drastic viewpoint shifts and lighting variations. For mapping, we propose a new probabilistic initialization strategy that encodes geometric uncertainty from tri-view correspondences into newly initialized Gaussians. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Attenuation of Rendering Trust mechanism to mitigate tracking drift caused by mapping latency. Experiments on multiple public outdoor datasets show that our TVG-SLAM outperforms prior RGB-only 3DGS-based SLAM systems. Notably, in the most challenging dataset, our method improves tracking robustness, reducing the average Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 69.0\\% while achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality.

    "abstract": "High-dynamic scene reconstruction aims to represent static background with rigid spatial features and dynamic objects with deformed continuous spatiotemporal features. Typically, existing methods adopt unified representation model (e.g., Gaussian) to directly match the spatiotemporal features of dynamic scene from frame camera. However, this unified paradigm fails in the potential discontinuous temporal features of objects due to frame imaging and the heterogeneous spatial features between background and objects. To address this issue, we disentangle the spatiotemporal features into various latent representations to alleviate the spatiotemporal mismatching between background and objects. In this work, we introduce event camera to compensate for frame camera, and propose a spatiotemporal-disentangled Gaussian splatting framework for high-dynamic scene reconstruction. As for dynamic scene, we figure out that background and objects have appearance discrepancy in frame-based spatial features and motion discrepancy in event-based temporal features, which motivates us to distinguish the spatiotemporal features between background and objects via clustering. As for dynamic object, we discover that Gaussian representations and event data share the consistent spatiotemporal characteristic, which could serve as a prior to guide the spatiotemporal disentanglement of object Gaussians. Within Gaussian splatting framework, the cumulative scene-object disentanglement can improve the spatiotemporal discrimination between background and objects to render the time-continuous dynamic scene. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.",

The key idea is to feed the input images to a sequence of learnable Forward and Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transforms, where low-pass filters are kept fixed, high-pass filters are learnable and initialized to zero, and an auxiliary orthogonality loss gradually activates fine frequencies. This wavelet-driven, coarse-to-fine process delays the formation of redundant fine Gaussians, allowing 3DGS to capture global structure first and refine detail only when necessary. Through extensive experiments, AutoOpti3DGS requires just a single filter learning-rate hyper-parameter, integrates seamlessly with existing efficient 3DGS frameworks, and consistently produces sparser scene representations more compatible with memory or storage-constrained hardware.",

To this end, we propose VoteSplat, a novel 3D scene understanding framework that integrates Hough voting with 3DGS. Specifically, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is utilized for instance segmentation, extracting objects, and generating 2D vote maps. We then embed spatial offset vectors into Gaussian primitives. These offsets construct 3D spatial votes by associating them with 2D image votes, while depth distortion constraints refine localization along the depth axis. For open-vocabulary object localization, VoteSplat maps 2D image semantics to 3D point clouds via voting points, reducing training costs associated with high-dimensional CLIP features while preserving semantic unambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of VoteSplat in open-vocabulary 3D instance localization, 3D point cloud understanding, click-based 3D object localization, hierarchical segmentation, and ablation studies.

A common clinical approach mitigates this by sorting projections into respiratory phases and reconstructing images per phase, but this does not account for breathing variability. Dynamic CBCT instead reconstructs images at each projection, capturing continuous motion without phase sorting. Recent advancements in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) offer powerful tools for modeling dynamic scenes, yet their application to dynamic CBCT remains underexplored. Existing 4DGS methods, such as HexPlane, use implicit motion representations, which are computationally expensive. While explicit low-rank motion models have been proposed, they lack spatial regularization, leading to inconsistencies in Gaussian motion. To address these limitations, we introduce a free-form deformation (FFD)-based spatial basis function and a deformation-informed framework that enforces consistency by coupling the temporal evolution of Gaussian's mean position, scale, and rotation under a unified deformation field. We evaluate our approach on six CBCT datasets, demonstrating superior image quality with a 6x speedup over HexPlane. These results highlight the potential of deformation-informed 4DGS for efficient, motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction. The code is available at https://github.com/Yuliang-Huang/DIGS.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in scene reconstruction have pushed toward highly realistic modeling of autonomous driving (AD) environments using 3D Gaussian splatting. However, the resulting reconstructions remain closely tied to the original observations and struggle to support photorealistic synthesis of significantly altered or novel driving scenarios. This work introduces MADrive, a memory-augmented reconstruction framework designed to extend the capabilities of existing scene reconstruction methods by replacing observed vehicles with visually similar 3D assets retrieved from a large-scale external memory bank. Specifically, we release MAD-Cars, a curated dataset of ${\\sim}70$K 360{\\deg} car videos captured in the wild and present a retrieval module that finds the most similar car instances in the memory bank, reconstructs the corresponding 3D assets from video, and integrates them into the target scene through orientation alignment and relighting. The resulting replacements provide complete multi-view representations of vehicles in the scene, enabling photorealistic synthesis of substantially altered configurations, as demonstrated in our experiments.

    "abstract": "Efficient three-dimensional reconstruction and real-time visualization are critical in surgical scenarios such as endoscopy. In recent years, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in efficient 3D reconstruction and rendering. Most 3DGS-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods only rely on the appearance constraints for optimizing both 3DGS and camera poses. However, in endoscopic scenarios, the challenges include photometric inconsistencies caused by non-Lambertian surfaces and dynamic motion from breathing affects the performance of SLAM systems. To address these issues, we additionally introduce optical flow loss as a geometric constraint, which effectively constrains both the 3D structure of the scene and the camera motion. Furthermore, we propose a depth regularisation strategy to mitigate the problem of photometric inconsistencies and ensure the validity of 3DGS depth rendering in endoscopic scenes. In addition, to improve scene representation in the SLAM system, we improve the 3DGS refinement strategy by focusing on viewpoints corresponding to Keyframes with suboptimal rendering quality frames, achieving better rendering results. Extensive experiments on the C3VD static dataset and the StereoMIS dynamic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis and pose estimation, exhibiting high performance in both static and dynamic surgical scenes.",

Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning pretrained 2D diffusion models or directly generating 3D information through fast network inference or 3D Gaussian Splatting, but their results generally suffer from poor multiview consistency and lack geometric detail. To takle these issues, we present a novel method that seamlessly integrates geometry and perception priors without requiring additional model training to reconstruct detailed 3D objects from a single image. Specifically, we train three different Gaussian branches initialized from the geometry prior, perception prior and Gaussian noise, respectively. The geometry prior captures the rough 3D shapes, while the perception prior utilizes the 2D pretrained diffusion model to enhance multiview information. Subsequently, we refine 3D Gaussian branches through mutual interaction between geometry and perception priors, further enhanced by a reprojection-based strategy that enforces depth consistency. Experiments demonstrate the higher-fidelity reconstruction results of our method, outperforming existing methods on novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction, demonstrating robust and consistent 3D object generation.",

To free users from 3D annotations and limited scene exploration, we propose using locally reconstructed light fields and visualizing errors to be removed by inserting new views. Our results show that the error-peaking visualization is less invasive, reduces disappointment in final results, and is satisfactory with fewer view samples in our mobile view synthesis system.

Existing novel view synthesis methods are often constrained by their reliance on high-resolution images or strong assumptions about static geometry and rigid scene priors. Consequently, their approaches lack robustness in real-world environments with dynamic object and camera motion, leading to instability and degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we propose Motion-aware Dynamic View Synthesis from Blurry Monocular Video via Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting (DBMovi-GS), a method designed for dynamic view synthesis from blurry monocular videos. Our model generates dense 3D Gaussians, restoring sharpness from blurry videos and reconstructing detailed 3D geometry of the scene affected by dynamic motion variations.

However, performing accurate and efficient clipping for Gaussian Splatting remains a challenging and unresolved problem, primarily due to the volumetric nature of Gaussian primitives, which makes hard clipping incapable of precisely localizing their pixel-level contributions. In this paper, we propose a hybrid rendering framework that combines rasterization and ray tracing to achieve efficient and high-fidelity clipping of Gaussian Splatting data. At the core of our method is the RaRa strategy, which first leverages rasterization to quickly identify Gaussians intersected by the clipping plane, followed by ray tracing to compute attenuation weights based on their partial occlusion. These weights are then used to accurately estimate each Gaussian's contribution to the final image, enabling smooth and continuous clipping effects. We validate our approach on diverse datasets, including general Gaussians, hair strand Gaussians, and multi-layer Gaussians, and conduct user studies to evaluate both perceptual quality and quantitative performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method delivers visually superior results while maintaining real-time rendering performance and preserving high fidelity in the unclipped regions.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional target reconstruction from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is crucial for interpreting complex scattering information in SAR data. However, the intricate electromagnetic scattering mechanisms inherent to SAR imaging pose significant reconstruction challenges. Inspired by the remarkable success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) in optical domain reconstruction, this paper presents a novel SAR Differentiable Gaussian Splatting Rasterizer (SDGR) specifically designed for SAR target reconstruction. Our approach combines Gaussian splatting with the Mapping and Projection Algorithm to compute scattering intensities of Gaussian primitives and generate simulated SAR images through SDGR. Subsequently, the loss function between the rendered image and the ground truth image is computed to optimize the Gaussian primitive parameters representing the scene, while a custom CUDA gradient flow is employed to replace automatic differentiation for accelerated gradient computation. Through experiments involving the rendering of simplified architectural targets and SAR images of multiple vehicle targets, we validate the imaging rationality of SDGR on simulated SAR imagery. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our method for target reconstruction is demonstrated on both simulated and real-world datasets containing multiple vehicle targets, with quantitative evaluations conducted to assess its reconstruction performance. Experimental results indicate that our approach can effectively reconstruct the geometric structures and scattering properties of targets, thereby providing a novel solution for 3D reconstruction in the field of SAR imaging.",

In this paper, we propose ManiGaussian++, an extension of ManiGaussian framework that improves multi-task bimanual manipulation by digesting multi-body scene dynamics through a hierarchical Gaussian world model. To be specific, we first generate task-oriented Gaussian Splatting from intermediate visual features, which aims to differentiate acting and stabilizing arms for multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics modeling. We then build a hierarchical Gaussian world model with the leader-follower architecture, where the multi-body spatiotemporal dynamics is mined for intermediate visual representation via future scene prediction. The leader predicts Gaussian Splatting deformation caused by motions of the stabilizing arm, through which the follower generates the physical consequences resulted from the movement of the acting arm. As a result, our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art bimanual manipulation techniques by an improvement of 20.2% in 10 simulated tasks, and achieves 60% success rate on average in 9 challenging real-world tasks.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting has emerged as an expressive scene representation for RGB-D visual SLAM, but its application to large-scale, multi-agent outdoor environments remains unexplored. Multi-agent Gaussian SLAM is a promising approach to rapid exploration and reconstruction of environments, offering scalable environment representations, but existing approaches are limited to small-scale, indoor environments. To that end, we propose Gaussian Reconstruction via Multi-Agent Dense SLAM, or GRAND-SLAM, a collaborative Gaussian splatting SLAM method that integrates i) an implicit tracking module based on local optimization over submaps and ii) an approach to inter- and intra-robot loop closure integrated into a pose-graph optimization framework. Experiments show that GRAND-SLAM provides state-of-the-art tracking performance and 28% higher PSNR than existing methods on the Replica indoor dataset, as well as 91% lower multi-agent tracking error and improved rendering over existing multi-agent methods on the large-scale, outdoor Kimera-Multi dataset.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Novel View Synthesis aims to generate photorealistic views of moving subjects from arbitrary viewpoints. This task is particularly challenging when relying on monocular video, where disentangling structure from motion is ill-posed and supervision is scarce. We introduce Video Diffusion-Aware Reconstruction (ViDAR), a novel 4D reconstruction framework that leverages personalised diffusion models to synthesise a pseudo multi-view supervision signal for training a Gaussian splatting representation. By conditioning on scene-specific features, ViDAR recovers fine-grained appearance details while mitigating artefacts introduced by monocular ambiguity. To address the spatio-temporal inconsistency of diffusion-based supervision, we propose a diffusion-aware loss function and a camera pose optimisation strategy that aligns synthetic views with the underlying scene geometry. Experiments on DyCheck, a challenging benchmark with extreme viewpoint variation, show that ViDAR outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines in visual quality and geometric consistency. We further highlight ViDAR's strong improvement over baselines on dynamic regions and provide a new benchmark to compare performance in reconstructing motion-rich parts of the scene.

    "abstract": "Evaluating Generative 3D models remains challenging due to misalignment between automated metrics and human perception of quality. Current benchmarks rely on image-based metrics that ignore 3D structure or geometric measures that fail to capture perceptual appeal and real-world utility. To address this gap, we present 3D Arena, an open platform for evaluating image-to-3D generation models through large-scale human preference collection using pairwise comparisons.   Since launching in June 2024, the platform has collected 123,243 votes from 8,096 users across 19 state-of-the-art models, establishing the largest human preference evaluation for Generative 3D. We contribute the iso3d dataset of 100 evaluation prompts and demonstrate quality control achieving 99.75% user authenticity through statistical fraud detection. Our ELO-based ranking system provides reliable model assessment, with the platform becoming an established evaluation resource.   Through analysis of this preference data, we present insights into human preference patterns. Our findings reveal preferences for visual presentation features, with Gaussian splat outputs achieving a 16.6 ELO advantage over meshes and textured models receiving a 144.1 ELO advantage over untextured models. We provide recommendations for improving evaluation methods, including multi-criteria assessment, task-oriented evaluation, and format-aware comparison.

These challenges hinder the application in aerial surveying and autonomous driving. This paper proposes a novel solution to reconstruct large-scale surfaces with fine details, supervised by full-sized images. Firstly, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to reconstruct a coarse model efficiently, followed by adaptive scene partitioning and sub-scene refining from image segments. Additionally, we integrate a decoupling appearance model to capture global appearance variations and a transient mask model to mitigate interference from moving objects. Finally, we expand the multi-view constraint and introduce a single-view regularization for texture-less areas. Our experiments were conducted on the publicly available dataset GauU-Scene V2, which was captured using unmanned aerial vehicles. To the best of our knowledge, our method outperforms existing NeRF-based and Gaussian-based methods, achieving high-fidelity visual results and accurate surface from full-size image optimization.

However, most existing models assume clean and high-resolution (HR) multi-view inputs, which limits their robustness under real-world degradations such as noise, blur, low-resolution (LR), and weather-induced artifacts. To address these limitations, the emerging field of 3D Low-Level Vision (3D LLV) extends classical 2D Low-Level Vision tasks including super-resolution (SR), deblurring, weather degradation removal, restoration, and enhancement into the 3D spatial domain. This survey, referred to as R\\textsuperscript{3}eVision, provides a comprehensive overview of robust rendering, restoration, and enhancement for 3D LLV by formalizing the degradation-aware rendering problem and identifying key challenges related to spatio-temporal consistency and ill-posed optimization. Recent methods that integrate LLV into neural rendering frameworks are categorized to illustrate how they enable high-fidelity 3D reconstruction under adverse conditions. Application domains such as autonomous driving, AR/VR, and robotics are also discussed, where reliable 3D perception from degraded inputs is critical. By reviewing representative methods, datasets, and evaluation protocols, this work positions 3D LLV as a fundamental direction for robust 3D content generation and scene-level reconstruction in real-world environments.",

We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) \"transform\", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance.",

We address these challenges with a neural dynamics framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes, while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators, particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks.

Following the incremental pipeline, RA-NeRF reconstructs the scene using NeRF with photometric consistency and incorporates flow-driven pose regulation to enhance robustness during initialization and localization. Additionally, RA-NeRF employs an implicit pose filter to capture the camera movement pattern and eliminate the noise for pose estimation. To validate our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the Tanks\\&Temple dataset for standard evaluation, as well as the NeRFBuster dataset, which presents challenging camera pose trajectories.

To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the ''devil'' in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk++, which features a Dynamic Portrait Renderer with Gaussian Splatting to ensure consistent subject identity preservation and a Face-Sync Controller that aligns lip movements with speech while innovatively using a 3D facial blendshape model to reconstruct accurate facial expressions. To ensure natural head movements, we propose a Head-Sync Stabilizer, which optimizes head poses for greater stability. Additionally, SyncTalk++ enhances robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) audio by incorporating an Expression Generator and a Torso Restorer, which generate speech-matched facial expressions and seamless torso regions. Our approach maintains consistency and continuity in visual details across frames and significantly improves rendering speed and quality, achieving up to 101 frames per second.

    "abstract": "Some perspectives naturally provide more information than others. How can an AI system determine which viewpoint offers the most valuable insight for accurate and efficient 3D object reconstruction? Active view selection (AVS) for 3D reconstruction remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. The aim is to identify the minimal set of views that yields the most accurate 3D reconstruction. Instead of learning radiance fields, like NeRF or 3D Gaussian Splatting, from a current observation and computing uncertainty for each candidate viewpoint, we introduce a novel AVS approach guided by neural uncertainty maps predicted by a lightweight feedforward deep neural network, named UPNet. UPNet takes a single input image of a 3D object and outputs a predicted uncertainty map, representing uncertainty values across all possible candidate viewpoints. By leveraging heuristics derived from observing many natural objects and their associated uncertainty patterns, we train UPNet to learn a direct mapping from viewpoint appearance to uncertainty in the underlying volumetric representations. Next, our approach aggregates all previously predicted neural uncertainty maps to suppress redundant candidate viewpoints and effectively select the most informative one. Using these selected viewpoints, we train 3D neural rendering models and evaluate the quality of novel view synthesis against other competitive AVS methods. Remarkably, despite using half of the viewpoints than the upper bound, our method achieves comparable reconstruction accuracy. In addition, it significantly reduces computational overhead during AVS, achieving up to a 400 times speedup along with over 50\\% reductions in CPU, RAM, and GPU usage compared to baseline methods. Notably, our approach generalizes effectively to AVS tasks involving novel object categories, without requiring any additional training.",

To address this, we propose Hierarchical Gaussian Splatting (HRGS), a memory-efficient framework with hierarchical block-level optimization. First, we generate a global, coarse Gaussian representation from low-resolution data. Then, we partition the scene into multiple blocks, refining each block with high-resolution data. The partitioning involves two steps: Gaussian partitioning, where irregular scenes are normalized into a bounded cubic space with a uniform grid for task distribution, and training data partitioning, where only relevant observations are retained for each block. By guiding block refinement with the coarse Gaussian prior, we ensure seamless Gaussian fusion across adjacent blocks. To reduce computational demands, we introduce Importance-Driven Gaussian Pruning (IDGP), which computes importance scores for each Gaussian and removes those with minimal contribution, speeding up convergence and reducing memory usage. Additionally, we incorporate normal priors from a pretrained model to enhance surface reconstruction quality.

    "abstract": "Accurate action inference is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we propose a Vision-to-4D-to-Action (V-4D-A) framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing simultaneous modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF supports three key query types: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of initial action via robot motion. Furthermore, the high-quality current and future frames generated by GAF facilitate manipulation action refinement through a GAF-guided diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average success rate in robotic manipulation tasks by 10.33% over state-of-the-art methods.

In multi-task generalization experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves a success rate of 83% on trained tasks and 75% on unseen tasks in simulation. When deployed on real hardware, it attains 67% success on trained tasks and 50% on unseen ones. In multi-environment adaptation experiments, GRaD-Nav++ achieves an average success rate of 81% across diverse simulated environments and 67% across varied real-world settings.

While optimization-based methods can produce high-fidelity results from monocular or multi-view videos, they require accurate pose estimation and slow iterative optimization, limiting scalability in unconstrained scenarios. Recent feed-forward approaches enable efficient single-image reconstruction but struggle to effectively leverage multiple input images to reduce ambiguity and improve reconstruction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose PF-LHM, a large human reconstruction model that generates high-quality 3D avatars in seconds from one or multiple casually captured pose-free images. Our approach introduces an efficient Encoder-Decoder Point-Image Transformer architecture, which fuses hierarchical geometric point features and multi-view image features through multimodal attention. The fused features are decoded to recover detailed geometry and appearance, represented using 3D Gaussian splats. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method unifies single- and multi-image 3D human reconstruction, achieving high-fidelity and animatable 3D human avatars without requiring camera and human pose annotations.

However, these approaches still struggle to reconstruct smooth and reliable geometry, particularly in scenes with significant color variation across viewpoints, due to their per-point appearance modeling and single-view optimization constraints. In this paper, we propose an effective multiview geometric regularization strategy that integrates multiview stereo (MVS) depth, RGB, and normal constraints into Gaussian Splatting initialization and optimization. Our key insight is the complementary relationship between MVS-derived depth points and Gaussian Splatting-optimized positions: MVS robustly estimates geometry in regions of high color variation through local patch-based matching and epipolar constraints, whereas Gaussian Splatting provides more reliable and less noisy depth estimates near object boundaries and regions with lower color variation. To leverage this insight, we introduce a median depth-based multiview relative depth loss with uncertainty estimation, effectively integrating MVS depth information into Gaussian Splatting optimization. We also propose an MVS-guided Gaussian Splatting initialization to avoid Gaussians falling into suboptimal positions. Extensive experiments validate that our approach successfully combines these strengths, enhancing both geometric accuracy and rendering quality across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.",

    "abstract": "3D modeling of highly reflective objects remains challenging due to strong view-dependent appearances. While previous SDF-based methods can recover high-quality meshes, they are often time-consuming and tend to produce over-smoothed surfaces. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers the advantage of high speed and detailed real-time rendering, but extracting surfaces from the Gaussians can be noisy due to the lack of geometric constraints. To bridge the gap between these approaches, we propose a novel reconstruction method called GS-2DGS for reflective objects based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). Our approach combines the rapid rendering capabilities of Gaussian Splatting with additional geometric information from foundation models. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Gaussian-based techniques in terms of reconstruction and relighting and achieves performance comparable to SDF-based methods while being an order of magnitude faster.

Our framework overcomes these limitations by reformulating densification and pruning as a probabilistic sampling process, dynamically inserting and relocating Gaussians based on aggregated multi-view errors and opacity scores. Guided by Bayesian acceptance tests derived from these error-based importance scores, our method substantially reduces reliance on heuristics, offers greater flexibility, and adaptively infers Gaussian distributions without requiring predefined scene complexity. Experiments on benchmark datasets, including Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending, show that our approach reduces the number of Gaussians needed, enhancing computational efficiency while matching or modestly surpassing the view-synthesis quality of state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Modeling the wireless radiance field (WRF) is fundamental to modern communication systems, enabling key tasks such as localization, sensing, and channel estimation. Traditional approaches, which rely on empirical formulas or physical simulations, often suffer from limited accuracy or require strong scene priors. Recent neural radiance field (NeRF-based) methods improve reconstruction fidelity through differentiable volumetric rendering, but their reliance on computationally expensive multilayer perceptron (MLP) queries hinders real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gaussian splatting (GS) to the wireless domain, leveraging its efficiency in modeling optical radiance fields to enable compact and accurate WRF reconstruction. Specifically, we propose SwiftWRF, a deformable 2D Gaussian splatting framework that synthesizes WRF spectra at arbitrary positions under single-sided transceiver mobility. SwiftWRF employs CUDA-accelerated rasterization to render spectra at over 100000 fps and uses a lightweight MLP to model the deformation of 2D Gaussians, effectively capturing mobility-induced WRF variations. In addition to novel spectrum synthesis, the efficacy of SwiftWRF is further underscored in its applications in angle-of-arrival (AoA) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) prediction. Experiments conducted on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes demonstrate that SwiftWRF can reconstruct WRF spectra up to 500x faster than existing state-of-the-art methods, while significantly enhancing its signal quality.

Currently, the common approach in 3DGS is to utilize \"single-view\" mini-batch training, where only one image is processed per iteration, in contrast to NeRF's \"multi-view\" mini-batch training, which leverages multiple images. We observe that such single-view training can lead to suboptimal optimization due to increased variance in mini-batch stochastic gradients, highlighting the necessity for multi-view training. However, implementing multi-view training in 3DGS poses challenges. Simply rendering multiple images per iteration incurs considerable overhead and may result in suboptimal Gaussian densification due to its reliance on single-view assumptions. To address these issues, we modify the rasterization process to minimize the overhead associated with multi-view training and propose a 3D distance-aware D-SSIM loss and multi-view adaptive density control that better suits multi-view scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly enhance the performance of 3DGS and its variants, freeing 3DGS from the constraints of single-view training.",

While existing models perform well on novel view synthesis for isolated objects, they struggle to generalize to complex, cluttered scenes. To address this, GenMOJO decomposes the scene into individual objects, optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per object. This object-wise decomposition allows leveraging object-centric diffusion models to infer unobserved regions in novel viewpoints. It performs joint Gaussian splatting to render the full scene, capturing cross-object occlusions, and enabling occlusion-aware supervision. To bridge the gap between object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of videos, GenMOJO uses differentiable transformations that align generative and rendering constraints within a unified framework. The resulting model generates 4D object reconstructions over space and time, and produces accurate 2D and 3D point tracks from monocular input. Quantitative evaluations and perceptual human studies confirm that GenMOJO generates more realistic novel views of scenes and produces more accurate point tracks compared to existing approaches.",

Objects such as pliers, clamps, or cabinets require representations that capture not only geometry and color information, but also part seperation, connectivity, and joint parametrization. Furthermore, learning these representations becomes even more difficult with each additional degree of freedom. Complex articulated objects such as robot arms may have seven or more degrees of freedom, and the depth of their kinematic tree may be notably greater than the tools, drawers, and cabinets that are the typical subjects of articulated object research. To address these concerns, we introduce SPLATART - a pipeline for learning Gaussian splat representations of articulated objects from posed images, of which a subset contains image space part segmentations. SPLATART disentangles the part separation task from the articulation estimation task, allowing for post-facto determination of joint estimation and representation of articulated objects with deeper kinematic trees than previously exhibited. In this work, we present data on the SPLATART pipeline as applied to the syntheic Paris dataset objects, and qualitative results on a real-world object under spare segmentation supervision. We additionally present on articulated serial chain manipulators to demonstrate usage on deeper kinematic tree structures.",

    "abstract": "Addressing the task of 3D semantic occupancy prediction for autonomous driving, we tackle two key issues in existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods: (1) unified feature aggregation neglecting semantic correlations among similar categories and across regions, (2) boundary ambiguities caused by the lack of geometric constraints in MLP iterative optimization and (3) biased issues in dynamic-static object coupling optimization. We propose the GraphGSOcc model, a novel framework that combines semantic and geometric graph Transformer and decouples dynamic-static objects optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting-based Occupancy Prediction. We propose the Dual Gaussians Graph Attenntion, which dynamically constructs dual graph structures: a geometric graph adaptively calculating KNN search radii based on Gaussian poses, enabling large-scale Gaussians to aggregate features from broader neighborhoods while compact Gaussians focus on local geometric consistency; a semantic graph retaining top-M highly correlated nodes via cosine similarity to explicitly encode semantic relationships within and across instances. Coupled with the Multi-scale Graph Attention framework, fine-grained attention at lower layers optimizes boundary details, while coarsegrained attention at higher layers models object-level topology. On the other hand, we decouple dynamic and static objects by leveraging semantic probability distributions and design a Dynamic-Static Decoupled Gaussian Attention mechanism to optimize the prediction performance for both dynamic objects and static scenes. GraphGSOcc achieves state-ofthe-art performance on the SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes, OpenOcc and KITTI occupancy benchmarks. Experiments on the SurroundOcc dataset achieve an mIoU of 25.20%, reducing GPU memory to 6.8 GB, demonstrating a 1.97% mIoU improvement and 13.7% memory reduction compared to GaussianWorld.",

    "abstract": "2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space of each splat.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is an innovative rendering technique that surpasses the neural radiance field (NeRF) in both rendering speed and visual quality by leveraging an explicit 3D scene representation. Existing 3DGS approaches require a large number of calibrated views to generate a consistent and complete scene representation. When input views are limited, 3DGS tends to overfit the training views, leading to noticeable degradation in rendering quality. To address this limitation, we propose a Point-wise Feature-Aware Gaussian Splatting framework that enables real-time, high-quality rendering from sparse training views. Specifically, we first employ the latest stereo foundation model to estimate accurate camera poses and reconstruct a dense point cloud for Gaussian initialization. We then encode the colour attributes of each 3D Gaussian by sampling and aggregating multiscale 2D appearance features from sparse inputs. To enhance point-wise appearance representation, we design a point interaction network based on a self-attention mechanism, allowing each Gaussian point to interact with its nearest neighbors. These enriched features are subsequently decoded into Gaussian parameters through two lightweight multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) for final rendering. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms NeRF-based approaches and achieves competitive performance under few-shot settings compared to the state-of-the-art 3DGS methods.",

Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.",

Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD-tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques. Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural rendering.",

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time rendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due to the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion representations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in existing methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision, and weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively hinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these limitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured and consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It first identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses redundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided Deformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation, eliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained deformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor resolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level transformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate that HAIF-GS significantly outperforms prior dynamic 3DGS methods in rendering quality, temporal coherence, and reconstruction efficiency.",

Using neural networks trained on large-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations from sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high reconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D Gaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization are not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this limitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for generating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward 3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that systematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce View-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by projecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present Visibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy by aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis transformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an off-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression for 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only 6% of the storage size.

During training, we propose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard, eliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous methods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained end-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages semantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage, our UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields in real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve high-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the rendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can be further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) serves as a highly performant and efficient encoding of scene geometry, appearance, and semantics. Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors. Our codes, benchmark, and datasets will be made public to accelerate research in generalizable 3DGS scene understanding.",

    "abstract": "High-quality novel view synthesis for large-scale scenes presents a challenging dilemma in 3D computer vision. Existing methods typically partition large scenes into multiple regions, reconstruct a 3D representation using Gaussian splatting for each region, and eventually merge them for novel view rendering. They can accurately render specific scenes, yet they do not generalize effectively for two reasons: (1) rigid spatial partition techniques struggle with arbitrary camera trajectories, and (2) the merging of regions results in Gaussian overlap to distort texture details. To address these challenges, we propose TraGraph-GS, leveraging a trajectory graph to enable high-precision rendering for arbitrarily large-scale scenes. We present a spatial partitioning method for large-scale scenes based on graphs, which incorporates a regularization constraint to enhance the rendering of textures and distant objects, as well as a progressive rendering strategy to mitigate artifacts caused by Gaussian overlap. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance both on four aerial and four ground datasets and highlight its remarkable efficiency: our method achieves an average improvement of 1.86 dB in PSNR on aerial datasets and 1.62 dB on ground datasets compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Recent extensions of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to dynamic scenes achieve high-quality novel view synthesis by using neural networks to predict the time-varying deformation of each Gaussian. However, performing per-Gaussian neural inference at every frame poses a significant bottleneck, limiting rendering speed and increasing memory and compute requirements. In this paper, we present Speedy Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (SpeeDe3DGS), a general pipeline for accelerating the rendering speed of dynamic 3DGS and 4DGS representations by reducing neural inference through two complementary techniques. First, we propose a temporal sensitivity pruning score that identifies and removes Gaussians with low contribution to the dynamic scene reconstruction. We also introduce an annealing smooth pruning mechanism that improves pruning robustness in real-world scenes with imprecise camera poses. Second, we propose GroupFlow, a motion analysis technique that clusters Gaussians by trajectory similarity and predicts a single rigid transformation per group instead of separate deformations for each Gaussian. Together, our techniques accelerate rendering by $10.37\\times$, reduce model size by $7.71\\times$, and shorten training time by $2.71\\times$ on the NeRF-DS dataset. SpeeDe3DGS also improves rendering speed by $4.20\\times$ and $58.23\\times$ on the D-NeRF and HyperNeRF vrig datasets. Our methods are modular and can be integrated into any deformable 3DGS or 4DGS framework.",

The key innovation is our Hessian-assisted sampling strategy, which intelligently identifies regions that are likely to benefit from densification, ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike computationally intensive GANs or diffusion approaches, our method operates in real-time (0.015s per inference on a single consumer-grade GPU), making it practical for interactive applications.

    "abstract": "Validating autonomous driving (AD) systems requires diverse and safety-critical testing, making photorealistic virtual environments essential. Traditional simulation platforms, while controllable, are resource-intensive to scale and often suffer from a domain gap with real-world data. In contrast, neural reconstruction methods like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer a scalable solution for creating photorealistic digital twins of real-world driving scenes. However, they struggle with dynamic object manipulation and reusability as their per-scene optimization-based methodology tends to result in incomplete object models with integrated illumination effects. This paper introduces R3D2, a lightweight, one-step diffusion model designed to overcome these limitations and enable realistic insertion of complete 3D assets into existing scenes by generating plausible rendering effects-such as shadows and consistent lighting-in real time. This is achieved by training R3D2 on a novel dataset: 3DGS object assets are generated from in-the-wild AD data using an image-conditioned 3D generative model, and then synthetically placed into neural rendering-based virtual environments, allowing R3D2 to learn realistic integration. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that R3D2 significantly enhances the realism of inserted assets, enabling use-cases like text-to-3D asset insertion and cross-scene/dataset object transfer, allowing for true scalability in AD validation. To promote further research in scalable and realistic AD simulation, we will release our dataset and code, see https://research.zenseact.com/publications/R3D2/.",

However, its performance significantly degrades in wide-baseline scenarios due to limited texture details and geometric inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose ProSplat, a two-stage feed-forward framework designed for high-fidelity rendering under wide-baseline conditions. The first stage involves generating 3D Gaussian primitives via a 3DGS generator. In the second stage, rendered views from these primitives are enhanced through an improvement model. Specifically, this improvement model is based on a one-step diffusion model, further optimized by our proposed Maximum Overlap Reference view Injection (MORI) and Distance-Weighted Epipolar Attention (DWEA). MORI supplements missing texture and color by strategically selecting a reference view with maximum viewpoint overlap, while DWEA enforces geometric consistency using epipolar constraints. Additionally, we introduce a divide-and-conquer training strategy that aligns data distributions between the two stages through joint optimization. We evaluate ProSplat on the RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets under wide-baseline settings. Experimental results demonstrate that ProSplat achieves an average improvement of 1 dB in PSNR compared to recent SOTA methods.",

Despite its impressive algorithmic performance, real-time rendering on resource-constrained devices remains a major challenge due to tight power and area budgets. This paper presents an architecture-algorithm co-design to address these inefficiencies. First, we reveal substantial redundancy caused by repeated computation of common terms/expressions during the conventional rasterization. To resolve this, we propose axis-oriented rasterization, which pre-computes and reuses shared terms along both the X and Y axes through a dedicated hardware design, effectively reducing multiply-and-add (MAC) operations by up to 63%. Second, by identifying the resource and performance inefficiency of the sorting process, we introduce a novel neural sorting approach that predicts order-independent blending weights using an efficient neural network, eliminating the need for costly hardware sorters. A dedicated training framework is also proposed to improve its algorithmic stability. Third, to uniformly support rasterization and neural network inference, we design an efficient reconfigurable processing array that maximizes hardware utilization and throughput. Furthermore, we introduce a $\\pi$-trajectory tile schedule, inspired by Morton encoding and Hilbert curve, to optimize Gaussian reuse and reduce memory access overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design preserves rendering quality while achieving a speedup of $23.4\\sim27.8\\times$ and energy savings of $28.8\\sim51.4\\times$ compared to edge GPUs for real-world scenes.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated exceptional performance in image-based 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering. However, regions with complex textures require numerous Gaussians to capture significant color variations accurately, leading to inefficiencies in rendering speed. To address this challenge, we introduce a hybrid representation for indoor scenes that combines 3DGS with textured meshes. Our approach uses textured meshes to handle texture-rich flat areas, while retaining Gaussians to model intricate geometries. The proposed method begins by pruning and refining the extracted mesh to eliminate geometrically complex regions. We then employ a joint optimization for 3DGS and mesh, incorporating a warm-up strategy and transmittance-aware supervision to balance their contributions seamlessly.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the hybrid representation maintains comparable rendering quality and achieves superior frames per second FPS with fewer Gaussian primitives.",

    "abstract": "Mapping systems with novel view synthesis (NVS) capabilities are widely used in computer vision, with augmented reality, robotics, and autonomous driving applications. Most notably, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based systems show high NVS performance; however, many current approaches are limited to static scenes. While recent works have started addressing short-term dynamics (motion within the view of the camera), long-term dynamics (the scene evolving through changes out of view) remain less explored. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a dynamic scene adaptation mechanism that continuously updates the 3D representation to reflect the latest changes. In addition, since maintaining geometric and semantic consistency remains challenging due to stale observations disrupting the reconstruction process, we propose a novel keyframe management mechanism that discards outdated observations while preserving as much information as possible. We evaluate Gaussian Mapping for Evolving Scenes (GaME) on both synthetic and real-world datasets and find it to be more accurate than the state of the art.",

Building on this sensitivity, Single Photon Cameras (SPCs) enable image capture at exceptionally high speeds under both low and high illumination. Enabling 3D reconstruction and radiance field recovery from such SPC data holds significant promise. However, the binary nature of SPC images leads to severe information loss, particularly in texture and color, making traditional 3D synthesis techniques ineffective. To address this challenge, we propose a modular two-stage framework that converts binary SPC images into high-quality colorized novel views. The first stage performs image-to-image (I2I) translation using generative models such as Pix2PixHD, converting binary SPC inputs into plausible RGB representations. The second stage employs 3D scene reconstruction techniques like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate novel views. We validate our two-stage pipeline (Pix2PixHD + Nerf/3DGS) through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality and geometric consistency over the alternative baseline.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing demand to stylize a given 3D scene to align with the artistic style of reference images for creative purposes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting(GS) has emerged as a promising and efficient method for realistic 3D scene modeling, there remains a challenge in adapting it to stylize 3D GS to match with multiple styles through automatic local style transfer or manual designation, while maintaining memory efficiency for stylization training. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization solution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we employ a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify correspondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered images. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style loss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to various objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to enhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve memory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To better assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several techniques to regularize the segmentation network. As demonstrated by our comprehensive experiments, our approach outperforms existing ones in producing plausible stylization results and offering flexible editing.",

However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.",

While recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved rendering quality and efficiency, existing methods still face fundamental challenges, including time-consuming per-subject optimization and poor generalization under sparse monocular inputs. In this work, we present the Parametric Gaussian Human Model (PGHM), a generalizable and efficient framework that integrates human priors into 3DGS for fast and high-fidelity avatar reconstruction from monocular videos. PGHM introduces two core components: (1) a UV-aligned latent identity map that compactly encodes subject-specific geometry and appearance into a learnable feature tensor; and (2) a disentangled Multi-Head U-Net that predicts Gaussian attributes by decomposing static, pose-dependent, and view-dependent components via conditioned decoders. This design enables robust rendering quality under challenging poses and viewpoints, while allowing efficient subject adaptation without requiring multi-view capture or long optimization time. Experiments show that PGHM is significantly more efficient than optimization-from-scratch methods, requiring only approximately 20 minutes per subject to produce avatars with comparable visual quality, thereby demonstrating its practical applicability for real-world monocular avatar creation.",

We introduce a novel 3D reconstruction framework with a hierarchical Gaussian mixture model, inspired in part by Gaussian Splatting for 4D scene reconstruction. In particular, the structure of the model is grounded in an initial process that infers a part-based segmentation of the particle, providing essential inductive bias in order to handle both conformational and compositional variability.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) approaches have emerged as an option for SLAM with accurate, dense 3D map building. However, existing GS-based SLAM methods rely on per-scene optimization which is time-consuming and does not generalize to diverse scenes well. In this work, we introduce the first generalizable GS-based semantic SLAM algorithm that incrementally builds and updates a 3D scene representation from an RGB-D video stream using a learned generalizable network. Our approach starts from an RGB-D image recognition backbone to predict the Gaussian parameters from every downsampled and backprojected image location. Additionally, we seamlessly integrate 3D semantic segmentation into our GS framework, bridging 3D mapping and recognition through a shared backbone. To correct localization drifting and floaters, we propose to optimize the GS for only 1 iteration following global localization. We demonstrate state-of-the-art semantic SLAM performance on the real-world benchmark ScanNet with an order of magnitude fewer Gaussians compared to other recent GS-based methods, and showcase our model's generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to the NYUv2 and TUM RGB-D datasets.",

Our key observation is that our environment is often full of repetitive elements. We propose to leverage those repetitions to improve the reconstruction of low-quality parts of the scene due to poor coverage and occlusions. We propose a method that segments each repeated instance in a 3DGS reconstruction, registers them together, and allows information to be shared among instances. Our method improves the geometry while also accounting for appearance variations across instances.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Dy3DGS-SLAM, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) SLAM method for dynamic scenes using monocular RGB input. To address dynamic interference, we fuse optical flow masks and depth masks through a probabilistic model to obtain a fused dynamic mask. With only a single network iteration, this can constrain tracking scales and refine rendered geometry. Based on the fused dynamic mask, we designed a novel motion loss to constrain the pose estimation network for tracking. In mapping, we use the rendering loss of dynamic pixels, color, and depth to eliminate transient interference and occlusion caused by dynamic objects.

In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i) Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancing performance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

Nonetheless, pose estimation using Structure from Motion and 3DGS optimization can still each take between minutes and hours of computation after capture is complete. SLAM methods combined with 3DGS are fast but struggle with wide camera baselines and large scenes. We present an on-the-fly method to produce camera poses and a trained 3DGS immediately after capture. Our method can handle dense and wide-baseline captures of ordered photo sequences and large-scale scenes. To do this, we first introduce fast initial pose estimation, exploiting learned features and a GPU-friendly mini bundle adjustment. We then introduce direct sampling of Gaussian primitive positions and shapes, incrementally spawning primitives where required, significantly accelerating training. These two efficient steps allow fast and robust joint optimization of poses and Gaussian primitives. Our incremental approach handles large-scale scenes by introducing scalable radiance field construction, progressively clustering 3DGS primitives, storing them in anchors, and offloading them from the GPU. Clustered primitives are progressively merged, keeping the required scale of 3DGS at any viewpoint. We evaluate our solution on a variety of datasets and show that our solution can provide on-the-fly processing of all the capture scenarios and scene sizes we target while remaining competitive with other methods that only handle specific capture styles or scene sizes in speed, image quality, or both.",

    "abstract": "We present ODE-GS, a novel method that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting with latent neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to forecast dynamic 3D scenes far beyond the time span seen during training. Existing neural rendering systems - whether NeRF- or 3DGS-based - embed time directly in a deformation network and therefore excel at interpolation but collapse when asked to predict the future, where timestamps are strictly out-of-distribution. ODE-GS eliminates this dependency: after learning a high-fidelity, time-conditioned deformation model for the training window, we freeze it and train a Transformer encoder that summarizes past Gaussian trajectories into a latent state whose continuous evolution is governed by a neural ODE. Numerical integration of this latent flow yields smooth, physically plausible Gaussian trajectories that can be queried at any future instant and rendered in real time. Coupled with a variational objective and a lightweight second-derivative regularizer, ODE-GS attains state-of-the-art extrapolation on D-NeRF and NVFI benchmarks, improving PSNR by up to 10 dB and halving perceptual error (LPIPS) relative to the strongest baselines. Our results demonstrate that continuous-time latent dynamics are a powerful, practical route to photorealistic prediction of complex 3D scenes.",

This approach offers advantages such as efficient training, the use of known camera poses, and accurate geometry estimation. However, depth discontinuities at object boundaries often lead to fragmented or sparse point clouds, degrading rendering quality -- a well-known limitation of depth-based representations. To tackle this issue, we introduce PM-Loss, a novel regularization loss based on a pointmap predicted by a pre-trained transformer. Although the pointmap itself may be less accurate than the depth map, it effectively enforces geometric smoothness, especially around object boundaries. With the improved depth map, our method significantly improves the feed-forward 3DGS across various architectures and scenes, delivering consistently better rendering results.

However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.",

This challenge is particularly pronounced in the domain of robotics, where diverse and dynamic scenarios further complicate the creation of representative datasets. To address this, we propose a novel method for automatically generating annotated synthetic data in Unreal Engine. Our approach leverages photorealistic 3D Gaussian splats for rapid synthetic data generation. We demonstrate that synthetic datasets can achieve performance comparable to that of real-world datasets while significantly reducing the time required to generate and annotate data. Additionally, combining real-world and synthetic data significantly increases object detection performance by leveraging the quality of real-world images with the easier scalability of synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first application of synthetic data for training object detection algorithms in the highly dynamic and varied environment of robot soccer. Validation experiments reveal that a detector trained on synthetic images performs on par with one trained on manually annotated real-world images when tested on robot soccer match scenarios. Our method offers a scalable and comprehensive alternative to traditional dataset creation, eliminating the labour-intensive error-prone manual annotation process. By generating datasets in a simulator where all elements are intrinsically known, we ensure accurate annotations while significantly reducing manual effort, which makes it particularly valuable for robotics applications requiring diverse and scalable training data.",

Specifically, we address the challenge of reconstructing dynamic scenes with multiple moving pedestrians from monocular video data without the need for additional sensors. We use a combination of a 3D foundation model and a human mesh reconstruction model to reconstruct both the scene background and humans. We propose a novel approach to resolve the scene scale ambiguity and place both humans and the scene in world coordinates by identifying human-scene contact points. Additionally, we exploit the SMPL model and background mesh to initialize Gaussian splats, enabling holistic scene rendering. We evaluated our method on three complex UAV-captured datasets: VisDrone, Manipal-UAV, and Okutama-Action, each with distinct characteristics and 10~50 humans. Our results demonstrate the benefits of our approach over existing methods in novel view synthesis, achieving a 1.5 dB PSNR improvement and superior visual sharpness.",

These assets are placed in a simulated environment, where the point clouds are generated using a simulated LiDAR. This is a flexible approach that allows changing the LiDAR specifications without incurring additional costs. We evaluated the impact of synthetic data on segmentation models such as PointNet++, Point Transformer V3, and OACNN, by training and validating the models only on synthetic data. Remarkably, the PTv3 model had an mIoU of 91.35\\%, a noteworthy result given that the model had neither been trained nor validated on any real data. Further studies even suggested that in certain scenarios the models trained only on synthetically generated data performed better than models trained on real-world data. Finally, experiments demonstrated that the models can generalize across semantic classes, enabling accurate predictions on mesh models they were never trained on.",

We find that when fine-tuning stereo models on 3DGS-generated datasets, we demonstrate competitive performance in zero-shot generalization benchmarks. When using the reconstructed geometry directly, we observe that it is often noisy and contains artifacts, which propagate noise to the trained model. In contrast, we find that the disparity estimates from FoundationStereo are cleaner and consequently result in a better performance on the zero-shot generalization benchmarks. Our method highlights the potential for low-cost, high-fidelity dataset creation and fast fine-tuning for deep stereo models.

Existing methods often rely on task-specific embeddings that are tailored either for semantic understanding or geometric reconstruction. As a result, these embeddings typically cannot be decoded into explicit geometry and simultaneously reused across tasks. In this paper, we propose Object-X, a versatile multi-modal object representation framework capable of encoding rich object embeddings (e.g. images, point cloud, text) and decoding them back into detailed geometric and visual reconstructions. Object-X operates by geometrically grounding the captured modalities in a 3D voxel grid and learning an unstructured embedding fusing the information from the voxels with the object attributes. The learned embedding enables 3D Gaussian Splatting-based object reconstruction, while also supporting a range of downstream tasks, including scene alignment, single-image 3D object reconstruction, and localization. Evaluations on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that Object-X produces high-fidelity novel-view synthesis comparable to standard 3D Gaussian Splatting, while significantly improving geometric accuracy. Moreover, Object-X achieves competitive performance with specialized methods in scene alignment and localization. Critically, our object-centric descriptors require 3-4 orders of magnitude less storage compared to traditional image- or point cloud-based approaches, establishing Object-X as a scalable and highly practical solution for multi-modal 3D scene representation.",

Existing methodologies typically assume using frame-rate 6DoF pose estimated from the device's visual-inertial odometry system, which may neglect crucial details necessary for pixel-accurate reconstruction. This study presents two significant findings. Firstly, in contrast to mainstream work treating RGB camera as global shutter frame-rate camera, we emphasize the importance of employing visual-inertial bundle adjustment (VIBA) to calibrate the precise timestamps and movement of the rolling shutter RGB sensing camera in a high frequency trajectory format, which ensures an accurate calibration of the physical properties of the rolling-shutter camera. Secondly, we incorporate a physical image formation model based into Gaussian Splatting, which effectively addresses the sensor characteristics, including the rolling-shutter effect of RGB cameras and the dynamic ranges measured by sensors. Our proposed formulation is applicable to the widely-used variants of Gaussian Splats representation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our pipeline using the open-source Project Aria device under diverse indoor and outdoor lighting conditions, and further validate it on a Meta Quest3 device. Across all experiments, we observe a consistent visual enhancement of +1 dB in PSNR by incorporating VIBA, with an additional +1 dB achieved through our proposed image formation model.

Despite recent progress in generative AI such as diffusion models or rendering methods like Neural Radiance Fields or Gaussian Splatting, controlling the generation of accurate 3D humans from text prompts remains an open challenge. Current methods struggle with fine detail, accurate rendering of hands and faces, human realism, and controlability over appearance. The lack of diversity, realism, and annotation in human image data also remains a challenge, hindering the development of a foundational 3D human model. We present a weakly supervised pipeline that tries to address these challenges. In the first step, we generate a photorealistic human image dataset with controllable attributes such as appearance, race, gender, etc using a state-of-the-art image diffusion model. Next, we propose an efficient mapping approach from image features to 3D point clouds using a transformer-based architecture. Finally, we close the loop by training a point-cloud diffusion model that is conditioned on the same text prompts used to generate the original samples. We demonstrate orders-of-magnitude speed-ups in 3D human generation compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, along with significantly improved text-prompt alignment, realism, and rendering quality.

Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has enabled various applications in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis due to its efficient rendering capabilities. However, 3DGS demands relatively significant GPU memory, limiting its use on devices with restricted computational resources. Previous approaches have focused on pruning less important Gaussians, effectively compressing 3DGS but often requiring a fine-tuning stage and lacking adaptability for the specific memory needs of different devices. In this work, we present an elastic inference method for 3DGS. Given an input for the desired model size, our method selects and transforms a subset of Gaussians, achieving substantial rendering performance without additional fine-tuning. We introduce a tiny learnable module that controls Gaussian selection based on the input percentage, along with a transformation module that adjusts the selected Gaussians to complement the performance of the reduced model. Comprehensive experiments on ZipNeRF, MipNeRF and Tanks\\&Temples scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://flexgs.github.io.",

    "abstract": "Creating accurate, physical simulations directly from real-world robot motion holds great value for safe, scalable, and affordable robot learning, yet remains exceptionally challenging. Real robot data suffers from occlusions, noisy camera poses, dynamic scene elements, which hinder the creation of geometrically accurate and photorealistic digital twins of unseen objects. We introduce a novel real-to-sim framework tackling all these challenges at once. Our key insight is a hybrid scene representation merging the photorealistic rendering of 3D Gaussian Splatting with explicit object meshes suitable for physics simulation within a single representation. We propose an end-to-end optimization pipeline that leverages differentiable rendering and differentiable physics within MuJoCo to jointly refine all scene components - from object geometry and appearance to robot poses and physical parameters - directly from raw and imprecise robot trajectories. This unified optimization allows us to simultaneously achieve high-fidelity object mesh reconstruction, generate photorealistic novel views, and perform annotation-free robot pose calibration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach both in simulation and on challenging real-world sequences using an ALOHA 2 bi-manual manipulator, enabling more practical and robust real-to-simulation pipelines.",

However, existing methods face scalability limitations (requiring 3D supervision or costly annotations), robustness issues (being susceptible to local optima), and rendering shortcomings (lacking speed or photorealism). We introduce SplArt, a self-supervised, category-agnostic framework that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to reconstruct articulated objects and infer kinematics from two sets of posed RGB images captured at different articulation states, enabling real-time photorealistic rendering for novel viewpoints and articulations. SplArt augments 3DGS with a differentiable mobility parameter per Gaussian, achieving refined part segmentation. A multi-stage optimization strategy is employed to progressively handle reconstruction, part segmentation, and articulation estimation, significantly enhancing robustness and accuracy. SplArt exploits geometric self-supervision, effectively addressing challenging scenarios without requiring 3D annotations or category-specific priors.

    "abstract": "3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts. In this work, we propose Asymmetric Dual 3DGS, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency. Codes and trained models will be released.",

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.   Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.   Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).",

To address this, we introduce Gen4D, a fully automated pipeline for generating diverse and photorealistic 4D human animations.

However, integrating semantic information into this representation remains a significant challenge, especially in maintaining real-time performance for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) applications. In this work, we introduce LEG-SLAM -- a novel approach that fuses an optimized Gaussian Splatting implementation with visual-language feature extraction using DINOv2 followed by a learnable feature compressor based on Principal Component Analysis, while enabling an online dense SLAM. Our method simultaneously generates high-quality photorealistic images and semantically labeled scene maps, achieving real-time scene reconstruction with more than 10 fps on the Replica dataset and 18 fps on ScanNet. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction speed while achieving competitive rendering quality. The proposed system eliminates the need for prior data preparation such as camera's ego motion or pre-computed static semantic maps. With its potential applications in autonomous robotics, augmented reality, and other interactive domains, LEG-SLAM represents a significant step forward in real-time semantic 3D Gaussian-based SLAM.

    "abstract": "Computer System Architecture serves as a crucial bridge between software applications and the underlying hardware, encompassing components like compilers, CPUs, coprocessors, and RTL designs. Its development, from early mainframes to modern domain-specific architectures, has been driven by rising computational demands and advancements in semiconductor technology. However, traditional paradigms in computer system architecture design are confronting significant challenges, including a reliance on manual expertise, fragmented optimization across software and hardware layers, and high costs associated with exploring expansive design spaces. While automated methods leveraging optimization algorithms and machine learning have improved efficiency, they remain constrained by a single-stage focus, limited data availability, and a lack of comprehensive human domain knowledge. The emergence of large language models offers transformative opportunities for the design of computer system architecture. By leveraging the capabilities of LLMs in areas such as code generation, data analysis, and performance modeling, the traditional manual design process can be transitioned to a machine-based automated design approach. To harness this potential, we present the Large Processor Chip Model (LPCM), an LLM-driven framework aimed at achieving end-to-end automated computer architecture design. The LPCM is structured into three levels: Human-Centric; Agent-Orchestrated; and Model-Governed. This paper utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting as a representative workload and employs the concept of software-hardware collaborative design to examine the implementation of the LPCM at Level 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, this paper provides an in-depth discussion on the pathway to implementing Level 2 and Level 3 of the LPCM, along with an analysis of the existing challenges.",

However, rendering city-scale 3DGS scenes on mobile devices, e.g., your smartphones, remains a significant challenge due to the limited resources on mobile devices. A natural solution is to offload computation to the cloud; however, naively streaming rendered frames from the cloud to the client introduces high latency and requires bandwidth far beyond the capacity of current wireless networks.   In this paper, we propose an effective solution to enable city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Our key insight is that, under normal user motion, the number of newly visible Gaussians per second remains roughly constant. Leveraging this, we stream only the necessary Gaussians to the client. Specifically, on the cloud side, we propose asynchronous level-of-detail search to identify the necessary Gaussians for the client. On the client side, we accelerate rendering via a lookup table-based rasterization. Combined with holistic runtime optimizations, our system can deliver low-latency, city-scale 3DGS rendering on mobile devices. Compared to existing solutions, Voyager achieves over 100$\\times$ reduction on data transfer and up to 8.9$\\times$ speedup while retaining comparable rendering quality.",

To address this, we propose RobustSplat, a robust solution based on two critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization. Second, we design a scale-cascaded mask bootstrapping approach that first leverages lower-resolution feature similarity supervision for reliable initial transient mask estimation, taking advantage of its stronger semantic consistency and robustness to noise, and then progresses to high-resolution supervision to achieve more precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods, clearly demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.",

However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.",

    "abstract": "High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed, noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis. To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR / 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy), demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and scene reconstruction.

Existing methods based on neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization, and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts. Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time neural rendering across open-world scenarios.",

Contrary to existing 3DGS compression methods, our approach can produce compressed 3DGS models at multiple bitrates in a computationally efficient way. Point cloud voxelization is a discretization technique that point cloud codecs use to improve coding efficiency while enabling the use of fast transform coding algorithms. We propose an adaptive voxelization algorithm tailored to 3DGS data, to avoid the inefficiencies introduced by uniform voxelization used in point cloud codecs. We ensure the positions of larger volume Gaussians are represented at high resolution, as these significantly impact rendering quality. Meanwhile, a low-resolution representation is used for dense regions with smaller Gaussians, which have a relatively lower impact on rendering quality. This adaptive voxelization approach significantly reduces the number of Gaussians and the bitrate required to encode the 3DGS data. After voxelization, many Gaussians are moved or eliminated. Thus, we propose to fine-tune/recolor the remaining 3DGS attributes with an initialization that can reduce the amount of retraining required. Experimental results on pre-trained datasets show that our proposed compression framework outperforms existing methods.",

Many studies extend this paradigm for language-driven open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, most of them simply project 2D semantic features onto 3D Gaussians and overlook a fundamental gap between 2D and 3D understanding: a 3D object may exhibit various semantics from different viewpoints--a phenomenon we term view-dependent semantics. To address this challenge, we propose LaGa (Language Gaussians), which establishes cross-view semantic connections by decomposing the 3D scene into objects. Then, it constructs view-aggregated semantic representations by clustering semantic descriptors and reweighting them based on multi-view semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaGa effectively captures key information from view-dependent semantics, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Notably, under the same settings, LaGa achieves a significant improvement of +18.7% mIoU over the previous SOTA on the LERF-OVS dataset.

Further, we show strong generalization capabilities, maintaining high accuracy even with downsampled training data: using just \\(1\\%\\) of the training data returns \\(\\sim 45\\%\\) Recall@1, thus making GARLIC quite powerful for applications requiring both speed and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) marks a significant milestone in balancing the quality and efficiency of differentiable rendering. However, its high efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors, none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each 3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering.",

    "abstract": "Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models have recently emerged as a promising solution for novel view synthesis, enabling one-pass inference without the need for per-scene 3DGS optimization. However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state $Z$ that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state $Z$. We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

    "abstract": "Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the Mobi-$\\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness for policy mobilization.",

To address these limitations, we propose MixGS, a novel holistic optimization framework for large-scale 3D scene reconstruction. MixGS models the entire scene holistically by integrating camera pose and Gaussian attributes into a view-aware representation, which is decoded into fine-detailed Gaussians. Furthermore, a novel mixing operation combines decoded and original Gaussians to jointly preserve global coherence and local fidelity. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes demonstrate that MixGS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and competitive speed, while significantly reducing computational requirements, enabling large-scale scene reconstruction training on a single 24GB VRAM GPU.

We construct each LOD level by applying a depth-aware 3D smoothing filter, followed by importance-based pruning and fine-tuning to maintain visual fidelity. To further reduce memory overhead, we partition the scene into spatial chunks and dynamically load only relevant Gaussians during rendering, employing an opacity-blending mechanism to avoid visual artifacts at chunk boundaries.

In real-world scenarios, obtaining accurate poses is challenging, leading to noisy pose estimates and geometric misalignments. To address this, we introduce SHARE, a pose-free, feed-forward Gaussian splatting framework that overcomes these ambiguities by joint shape and camera rays estimation. Instead of relying on explicit 3D transformations, SHARE builds a pose-aware canonical volume representation that seamlessly integrates multi-view information, reducing misalignment caused by inaccurate pose estimates. Additionally, anchor-aligned Gaussian prediction enhances scene reconstruction by refining local geometry around coarse anchors, allowing for more precise Gaussian placement. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that our method achieves robust performance in pose-free generalizable Gaussian splatting.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods, such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation. Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for 3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms. This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal additional parameters and computational overhead.",

We present UP-SLAM, a real-time RGB-D SLAM system for dynamic environments that decouples tracking and mapping through a parallelized framework. A probabilistic octree is employed to manage Gaussian primitives adaptively, enabling efficient initialization and pruning without hand-crafted thresholds. To robustly filter dynamic regions during tracking, we propose a training-free uncertainty estimator that fuses multi-modal residuals to estimate per-pixel motion uncertainty, achieving open-set dynamic object handling without reliance on semantic labels. Furthermore, a temporal encoder is designed to enhance rendering quality. Concurrently, low-dimensional features are efficiently transformed via a shallow multilayer perceptron to construct DINO features, which are then employed to enrich the Gaussian field and improve the robustness of uncertainty prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets suggest that UP-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both localization accuracy (by 59.8%) and rendering quality (by 4.57 dB PSNR), while maintaining real-time performance and producing reusable, artifact-free static maps in dynamic environments.The project: https://aczheng-cai.github.io/up_slam.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Novel view synthesis is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision that aims to reconstruct realistic images from a set of posed input views. However, reconstruction quality degrades significantly under sparse-view conditions due to limited geometric cues. Existing methods, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and the more recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), often suffer from blurred details and structural artifacts when trained with insufficient views. Recent works have identified the quality of rendered depth as a key factor in mitigating these artifacts, as it directly affects geometric accuracy and view consistency. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing Hierarchical Depth-Guided Splatting (HDGS), a depth supervision framework that progressively refines geometry from coarse to fine levels. Central to HDGS is a novel Cascade Pearson Correlation Loss (CPCL), which aligns rendered and estimated monocular depths across multiple spatial scales. By enforcing multi-scale depth consistency, our method substantially improves structural fidelity in sparse-view scenarios. Extensive experiments on the LLFF and DTU benchmarks demonstrate that HDGS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse-view settings while maintaining efficient and high-quality rendering",

Recently, 3D reconstruction methods have been used to create implicit neural representations of HSI scenes, which can help localize the target object's nutrient composition spatially and spectrally. Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a cutting-edge implicit representation that can render hyperspectral channel compositions of each spatial location from any viewing direction. However, it faces limitations in training time and rendering speed. In this paper, we propose Hyperspectral Gaussian Splatting (HS-GS), which combines the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with a diffusion model to enable 3D explicit reconstruction of the hyperspectral scenes and novel view synthesis for the entire spectral range. To enhance the model's ability to capture fine-grained reflectance variations across the light spectrum and leverage correlations between adjacent wavelengths for denoising, we introduce a wavelength encoder to generate wavelength-specific spherical harmonics offsets. We also introduce a novel Kullback--Leibler divergence-based loss to mitigate the spectral distribution gap between the rendered image and the ground truth. A diffusion model is further applied for denoising the rendered images and generating photorealistic hyperspectral images. We present extensive evaluations on five diverse hyperspectral scenes from the Hyper-NeRF dataset to show the effectiveness of our proposed HS-GS framework. The results demonstrate that HS-GS achieves new state-of-the-art performance among all previously published methods. Code will be released upon publication.",

Our approach is a dual-branch optimization framework, consisting of an auxiliary 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization branch and a 3D vector graphics optimization branch. The introduced 3DGS branch can bridge the domain gaps between text prompts and vector graphics with more consistent guidance. Moreover, 3DGS allows for progressive detail control by scheduling classifier-free guidance, facilitating guiding vector graphics with coarse shapes at the initial stages and finer details at later stages. We also improve the view-dependent occlusions by devising a visibility-awareness rendering module.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in neural 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS), have enabled the accurate estimation of 3D structures from multiview images. However, this capability is limited to estimating the visible external structure, and identifying the invisible internal structure hidden behind the surface is difficult. To overcome this limitation, we address a new task called Structure from Collision (SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal structure) of an object from appearance changes during collision. To solve this problem, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF that optimizes the invisible internal structure of an object through a video sequence under physical, appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing; that is, searching for global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity shapes, locations, and sizes) and material properties revealed the properties of SfC and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF.",

Optical scattering and absorption in water body bring inhomogeneous medium attenuation interference that disrupts conventional volume rendering assumptions of uniform propagation medium. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers real-time rendering capabilities, it struggles with underwater inhomogeneous environments where scattering media introduce artifacts and inconsistent appearance. In this study, we propose a physics-based framework that disentangles object appearance from water medium effects through tailored Gaussian modeling. Our approach introduces appearance embeddings, which are explicit medium representations for backscatter and attenuation, enhancing scene consistency. In addition, we propose a distance-guided optimization strategy that leverages pseudo-depth maps as supervision with depth regularization and scale penalty terms to improve geometric fidelity. By integrating the proposed appearance and medium modeling components via an underwater imaging model, our approach achieves both high-quality novel view synthesis and physically accurate scene restoration.

While aerial imagery offers broad coverage and complements limitations of ground-based data, reconstructing city-scale environments from such views remains challenging due to occlusions, incomplete geometry, and high memory demands. Recent advances like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) improve scalability and visual quality but remain limited by dense primitive usage, long training times, and poor suit ability for edge devices. We propose CityGo, a hybrid framework that combines textured proxy geometry with residual and surrounding 3D Gaussians for lightweight, photorealistic rendering of urban scenes from aerial perspectives. Our approach first extracts compact building proxy meshes from MVS point clouds, then uses zero order SH Gaussians to generate occlusion-free textures via image-based rendering and back-projection. To capture high-frequency details, we introduce residual Gaussians placed based on proxy-photo discrepancies and guided by depth priors. Broader urban context is represented by surrounding Gaussians, with importance-aware downsampling applied to non-critical regions to reduce redundancy. A tailored optimization strategy jointly refines proxy textures and Gaussian parameters, enabling real-time rendering of complex urban scenes on mobile GPUs with significantly reduced training and memory requirements. Extensive experiments on real-world aerial datasets demonstrate that our hybrid representation significantly reduces training time, achieving on average 1.4x speedup, while delivering comparable visual fidelity to pure 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches. Furthermore, CityGo enables real-time rendering of large-scale urban scenes on mobile consumer GPUs, with substantially reduced memory usage and energy consumption.",

Grounded in fundamental physics, we uncover the complex relationship between EM wave propagation behaviors and RF frequencies. Inspired by this, we design an EM feature network with attenuation and radiance modules to learn the complex relationships between RF frequencies and the key properties of each 3D Gaussian, specifically the attenuation factor and RF signal intensity. By training the frequency-embedded 3DGS model, we can efficiently reconstruct RF radiance fields at arbitrary unknown frequencies within a given 3D environment. Finally, we propose a large-scale power angular spectrum (PAS) dataset containing 50000 samples ranging from 1 to 100 GHz in 6 indoor environments, and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. Our approach achieves an average Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) up to 0.72, and a significant improvement up to 17.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods trained on individual test frequencies. Additionally, our method achieves an SSIM of 0.70 without prior training on these frequencies, which represents only a 2.8% performance drop compared to models trained with full PAS data.

Existing dynamic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to effectively learn underlying dynamics or rely heavily on manually defined physical priors, which limits their extrapolation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting prior-free motion extrapolation framework based on particle dynamics systems. The core advantage of our method lies in its ability to learn differential equations that describe the dynamics of 3D Gaussians, and follow them during future frame extrapolation. Instead of simply fitting to the observed visual frame sequence, we aim to more effectively model the gaussian particle dynamics system. To this end, we introduce a dynamics latent state vector into the standard Gaussian kernel and design a dynamics latent space encoder to extract initial state. Subsequently, we introduce a Neural ODEs-based dynamics module that models the temporal evolution of Gaussian in dynamics latent space. Finally, a Gaussian kernel space decoder is used to decode latent state at the specific time step into the deformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable rendering quality with existing approaches in reconstruction tasks, and significantly outperforms them in future frame extrapolation.

The use of multiple 360-degree omnidirectional images for these tasks is increasingly favored due to advantages in data acquisition and comprehensive scene capture. However, the inherent geometric distortions in common omnidirectional representations, such as equirectangular projection (particularly severe in polar regions and varying with latitude), pose substantial challenges to achieving high-fidelity 3D reconstructions. Current datasets, while valuable, often lack the specific focus, scene composition, and ground truth granularity required to systematically benchmark and drive progress in overcoming these omnidirectional-specific challenges.

OB3D features diverse and complex 3D scenes generated from Blender 3D projects, with a deliberate emphasis on challenging scenarios. The dataset provides comprehensive ground truth, including omnidirectional RGB images, precise omnidirectional camera parameters, and pixel-aligned equirectangular maps for depth and normals, alongside evaluation metrics.

    "abstract": "Gaussian Splatting (GS) has gained attention as a fast and effective method for novel view synthesis. It has also been applied to 3D reconstruction using multi-view images and can achieve fast and accurate 3D reconstruction. However, GS assumes that the input contains a large number of multi-view images, and therefore, the reconstruction accuracy significantly decreases when only a limited number of input images are available. One of the main reasons is the insufficient number of 3D points in the sparse point cloud obtained through Structure from Motion (SfM), which results in a poor initialization for optimizing the Gaussian primitives. We propose a new 3D reconstruction method, called Sparse2DGS, to enhance 2DGS in reconstructing objects using only three images. Sparse2DGS employs DUSt3R, a fundamental model for stereo images, along with COLMAP MVS to generate highly accurate and dense 3D point clouds, which are then used to initialize 2D Gaussians. Through experiments on the DTU dataset, we show that Sparse2DGS can accurately reconstruct the 3D shapes of objects using just three images.

In this paper, we argue for a triangle comeback. We develop a differentiable renderer that directly optimizes triangles via end-to-end gradients. We achieve this by rendering each triangle as differentiable splats, combining the efficiency of triangles with the adaptive density of representations based on independent primitives. Compared to popular 2D and 3D Gaussian Splatting methods, our approach achieves higher visual fidelity, faster convergence, and increased rendering throughput. On the Mip-NeRF360 dataset, our method outperforms concurrent non-volumetric primitives in visual fidelity and achieves higher perceptual quality than the state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF on indoor scenes. Triangles are simple, compatible with standard graphics stacks and GPU hardware, and highly efficient: for the \\textit{Garden} scene, we achieve over 2,400 FPS at 1280x720 resolution using an off-the-shelf mesh renderer. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of triangle-based representations for high-quality novel view synthesis. Triangles bring us closer to mesh-based optimization by combining classical computer graphics with modern differentiable rendering frameworks.

    "abstract": "Scene understanding based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently achieved notable advances. Although 3DGS related methods have efficient rendering capabilities, they fail to address the inherent contradiction between the anisotropic color representation of gaussian primitives and the isotropic requirements of semantic features, leading to insufficient cross-view feature consistency. To overcome the limitation, we proposes $\\textit{FHGS}$ (Feature-Homogenized Gaussian Splatting), a novel 3D feature fusion framework inspired by physical models, which can achieve high-precision mapping of arbitrary 2D features from pre-trained models to 3D scenes while preserving the real-time rendering efficiency of 3DGS. Specifically, our $\\textit{FHGS}$ introduces the following innovations: Firstly, a universal feature fusion architecture is proposed, enabling robust embedding of large-scale pre-trained models' semantic features (e.g., SAM, CLIP) into sparse 3D structures. Secondly, a non-differentiable feature fusion mechanism is introduced, which enables semantic features to exhibit viewpoint independent isotropic distributions. This fundamentally balances the anisotropic rendering of gaussian primitives and the isotropic expression of features; Thirdly, a dual-driven optimization strategy inspired by electric potential fields is proposed, which combines external supervision from semantic feature fields with internal primitive clustering guidance. This mechanism enables synergistic optimization of global semantic alignment and local structural consistency. More interactive results can be accessed on: https://fhgs.cuastro.org/.",

However, novel-view synthesis with thermal infrared images suffers from transmission effects, emissivity, and low resolution, leading to floaters and blur effects in rendered images. To address these problems, we introduce Veta-GS, which leverages a view-dependent deformation field and a Thermal Feature Extractor (TFE) to precisely capture subtle thermal variations and maintain robustness. Specifically, we design view-dependent deformation field that leverages camera position and viewing direction, which capture thermal variations.

    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate the advantages of hardware rasterization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in forward-pass rendering through fast GPU-optimized graphics and fixed memory footprint. However, extending these benefits to backward-pass gradient computation remains challenging due to graphics pipeline constraints. We present a differentiable hardware rasterizer for 3DGS that overcomes the memory and performance limitations of tile-based software rasterization. Our solution employs programmable blending for per-pixel gradient computation combined with a hybrid gradient reduction strategy (quad-level + subgroup) in fragment shaders, achieving over 10x faster backward rasterization versus naive atomic operations and 3x speedup over the canonical tile-based rasterizer. Systematic evaluation reveals 16-bit render targets (float16 and unorm16) as the optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off, achieving higher gradient accuracy among mixed-precision rendering formats with execution speeds second only to unorm8, while float32 texture incurs severe forward pass performance degradation due to suboptimal hardware optimizations. Our method with float16 formats demonstrates 3.07x acceleration in full pipeline execution (forward + backward passes) on RTX4080 GPUs with the MipNeRF dataset, outperforming the baseline tile-based renderer while preserving hardware rasterization's memory efficiency advantages -- incurring merely 2.67% of the memory overhead required for splat sorting operations. This work presents a unified differentiable hardware rasterization method that simultaneously optimizes runtime and memory usage for 3DGS, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained devices with limited memory capacity.",

However, it encounters challenges for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) due to the coarse nature of primitives derived from low-resolution input views. To address this issue, we propose SuperGS, an expansion of Scaffold-GS designed with a two-stage coarse-to-fine training framework. In the low-resolution stage, we introduce a latent feature field to represent the low-resolution scene, which serves as both the initialization and foundational information for super-resolution optimization. In the high-resolution stage, we propose a multi-view consistent densification strategy that backprojects high-resolution depth maps based on error maps and employs a multi-view voting mechanism, mitigating ambiguities caused by multi-view inconsistencies in the pseudo labels provided by 2D prior models while avoiding Gaussian redundancy. Furthermore, we model uncertainty through variational feature learning and use it to guide further scene representation refinement and adjust the supervisory effect of pseudo-labels, ensuring consistent and detailed scene reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SuperGS outperforms state-of-the-art HRNVS methods on both forward-facing and 360-degree datasets.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and scalable quantification of animal pose and appearance is crucial for studying behavior. Current 3D pose estimation techniques, such as keypoint- and mesh-based techniques, often face challenges including limited representational detail, labor-intensive annotation requirements, and expensive per-frame optimization. These limitations hinder the study of subtle movements and can make large-scale analyses impractical. We propose Pose Splatter, a novel framework leveraging shape carving and 3D Gaussian splatting to model the complete pose and appearance of laboratory animals without prior knowledge of animal geometry, per-frame optimization, or manual annotations. We also propose a novel rotation-invariant visual embedding technique for encoding pose and appearance, designed to be a plug-in replacement for 3D keypoint data in downstream behavioral analyses. Experiments on datasets of mice, rats, and zebra finches show Pose Splatter learns accurate 3D animal geometries. Notably, Pose Splatter represents subtle variations in pose, provides better low-dimensional pose embeddings over state-of-the-art as evaluated by humans, and generalizes to unseen data. By eliminating annotation and per-frame optimization bottlenecks, Pose Splatter enables analysis of large-scale, longitudinal behavior needed to map genotype, neural activity, and micro-behavior at unprecedented resolution.",

Drawing on ideas from residual learning, we hierarchically decompose the dynamic scene into a \"video-segment-frame\" structure, with segments dynamically adjusted by optical flow. Then, instead of directly predicting the time-dependent signals, we model the signal as the sum of video-constant values, segment-constant values, and frame-specific residuals, as inspired by the success of residual learning. This approach allows more flexible models that adapt to highly variable scenes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets, with the greatest improvements on complex scenes with large movements, occlusions, and fine details, where current methods degrade most.",

    "abstract": "We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details. This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy, ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity, Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2.

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency, as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions, focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D scene generation.

In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and scene understanding.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction that integrates three key components: an explicit tri-plane deformation field, a view-conditioned canonical radiance field with spherical harmonics (SH) attention, and a temporally-aware latent diffusion prior. Our method encodes 4D scenes using three orthogonal 2D feature planes that evolve over time, enabling efficient and compact spatiotemporal representation. These features are explicitly warped into a canonical space via a deformation offset field, eliminating the need for MLP-based motion modeling.   In canonical space, we replace traditional MLP decoders with a structured SH-based rendering head that synthesizes view-dependent color via attention over learned frequency bands improving both interpretability and rendering efficiency. To further enhance fidelity and temporal consistency, we introduce a transformer-guided latent diffusion module that refines the tri-plane and deformation features in a compressed latent space. This generative module denoises scene representations under ambiguous or out-of-distribution (OOD) motion, improving generalization.   Our model is trained in two stages: the diffusion module is first pre-trained independently, and then fine-tuned jointly with the full pipeline using a combination of image reconstruction, diffusion denoising, and temporal consistency losses. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on synthetic benchmarks, surpassing recent methods such as HexPlane and 4D Gaussian Splatting in visual quality, temporal coherence, and robustness to sparse-view dynamic inputs.",

However, existing online methods face challenge in prohibitive storage requirements primarily due to point-wise modeling that fails to exploit the motion properties. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Compact Gaussian Streaming (ComGS) framework, leveraging the locality and consistency of motion in dynamic scene, that models object-consistent Gaussian point motion through keypoint-driven motion representation. By transmitting only the keypoint attributes, this framework provides a more storage-efficient solution. Specifically, we first identify a sparse set of motion-sensitive keypoints localized within motion regions using a viewspace gradient difference strategy. Equipped with these keypoints, we propose an adaptive motion-driven mechanism that predicts a spatial influence field for propagating keypoint motion to neighboring Gaussian points with similar motion. Moreover, ComGS adopts an error-aware correction strategy for key frame reconstruction that selectively refines erroneous regions and mitigates error accumulation without unnecessary overhead. Overall, ComGS achieves a remarkable storage reduction of over 159 X compared to 3DGStream and 14 X compared to the SOTA method QUEEN, while maintaining competitive visual fidelity and rendering speed. Our code will be released.",

However, generating complex 3D objects, such as plants, remains a considerable challenge. Current generative 3D models struggle with plant generation compared to general objects, limiting their usability in plant analysis tools, which require fine detail and accurate geometry. We introduce PlantDreamer, a novel approach to 3D synthetic plant generation, which can achieve greater levels of realism for complex plant geometry and textures than available text-to-3D models. To achieve this, our new generation pipeline leverages a depth ControlNet, fine-tuned Low-Rank Adaptation and an adaptable Gaussian culling algorithm, which directly improve textural realism and geometric integrity of generated 3D plant models. Additionally, PlantDreamer enables both purely synthetic plant generation, by leveraging L-System-generated meshes, and the enhancement of real-world plant point clouds by converting them into 3D Gaussian Splats. We evaluate our approach by comparing its outputs with state-of-the-art text-to-3D models, demonstrating that PlantDreamer outperforms existing methods in producing high-fidelity synthetic plants. Our results indicate that our approach not only advances synthetic plant generation, but also facilitates the upgrading of legacy point cloud datasets, making it a valuable tool for 3D phenotyping applications.",

We conceptualize Gaussian primitives as point clouds and propose leveraging point cloud compression techniques for more effective storage. AI-based point cloud compression demonstrates superior performance and faster inference compared to MPEG Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC).

To address these challenges, we introduce GausPcgc for Gaussian point cloud geometry compression along with a specialized training dataset GausPcc-1K. Our work pioneers the integration of AI-based point cloud compression into Gaussian compression pipelines, achieving superior compression ratios. The framework complements existing Gaussian compression methods while delivering significant performance improvements.

Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods.

    "abstract": "Currently almost all state-of-the-art novel view synthesis and reconstruction models rely on calibrated cameras or additional geometric priors for training. These prerequisites significantly limit their applicability to massive uncalibrated data. To alleviate this requirement and unlock the potential for self-supervised training on large-scale uncalibrated videos, we propose a novel two-stage strategy to train a view synthesis model from only raw video frames or multi-view images, without providing camera parameters or other priors. In the first stage, we learn to reconstruct the scene implicitly in a latent space without relying on any explicit 3D representation. Specifically, we predict per-frame latent camera and scene context features, and employ a view synthesis model as a proxy for explicit rendering. This pretraining stage substantially reduces the optimization complexity and encourages the network to learn the underlying 3D consistency in a self-supervised manner. The learned latent camera and implicit scene representation have a large gap compared with the real 3D world. To reduce this gap, we introduce the second stage training by explicitly predicting 3D Gaussian primitives. We additionally apply explicit Gaussian Splatting rendering loss and depth projection loss to align the learned latent representations with physically grounded 3D geometry. In this way, Stage 1 provides a strong initialization and Stage 2 enforces 3D consistency - the two stages are complementary and mutually beneficial. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high-quality novel view synthesis and accurate camera pose estimation, compared to methods that employ supervision with calibration, pose, or depth information.

Conventional FLFM reconstruction methods, such as Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, exhibit poor axial resolution and signal degradation due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. While data-driven approaches enhance spatial resolution by leveraging high-quality paired datasets or imposing structural priors, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods employ physics-informed self-supervised learning to overcome these limitations, yet they are hindered by substantial computational costs and memory demands. Therefore, we propose 3D Gaussian Adaptive Tomography (3DGAT) for FLFM, a 3D gaussian splatting based self-supervised learning framework that significantly improves the volumetric reconstruction quality of FLFM while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves higher resolution and improved reconstruction accuracy, highlighting its potential to advance FLFM imaging and broaden its applications in 3D optical microscopy.",

    "abstract": "The performance of multi-modal 3D occupancy prediction is limited by ineffective fusion, mainly due to geometry-semantics mismatch from fixed fusion strategies and surface detail loss caused by sparse, noisy annotations. The mismatch stems from the heterogeneous scale and distribution of point cloud and image features, leading to biased matching under fixed neighborhood fusion. To address this, we propose a target-scale adaptive, bidirectional symmetric retrieval mechanism. It expands the neighborhood for large targets to enhance context awareness and shrinks it for small ones to improve efficiency and suppress noise, enabling accurate cross-modal feature alignment. This mechanism explicitly establishes spatial correspondences and improves fusion accuracy. For surface detail loss, sparse labels provide limited supervision, resulting in poor predictions for small objects. We introduce an improved volume rendering pipeline based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, which takes fused features as input to render images, applies photometric consistency supervision, and jointly optimizes 2D-3D consistency. This enhances surface detail reconstruction while suppressing noise propagation. In summary, we propose TACOcc, an adaptive multi-modal fusion framework for 3D semantic occupancy prediction, enhanced by volume rendering supervision. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks validate its effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "In embedded systems, robots must perceive and interpret their environment efficiently to operate reliably in real-world conditions. Visual Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) enhances standard SLAM by incorporating semantic information into the map, enabling more informed decision-making. However, implementing such systems on resource-limited hardware involves trade-offs between accuracy, computing efficiency, and power usage.   This paper provides a comparative review of recent Semantic Visual SLAM methods with a focus on their applicability to embedded platforms. We analyze three main types of architectures - Geometric SLAM, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), and 3D Gaussian Splatting - and evaluate their performance on constrained hardware, specifically the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. We compare their accuracy, segmentation quality, memory usage, and energy consumption.   Our results show that methods based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting achieve high semantic detail but demand substantial computing resources, limiting their use on embedded devices. In contrast, Semantic Geometric SLAM offers a more practical balance between computational cost and accuracy. The review highlights a need for SLAM algorithms that are better adapted to embedded environments, and it discusses key directions for improving their efficiency through algorithm-hardware co-design.",

Addressing the limitations of existing methods that rely on dense multi-view images or detailed part-level annotations, we propose an innovative framework that can analyze 3D mobility from monocular videos in a zero-shot manner. This framework can precisely parse motion parts and motion attributes only using a monocular video, completely eliminating the need for annotated training data. Specifically, our method first constructs the scene geometry and roughly analyzes the motion parts and their initial motion attributes combining depth estimation, optical flow analysis and point cloud registration method, then employs 2D Gaussian splatting for scene representation. Building on this, we introduce an end-to-end dynamic scene optimization algorithm specifically designed for articulated objects, refining the initial analysis results to ensure the system can handle 'rotation', 'translation', and even complex movements ('rotation+translation'), demonstrating high flexibility and versatility. To validate the robustness and wide applicability of our method, we created a comprehensive dataset comprising both simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our framework can effectively analyze articulated object motions in an annotation-free manner, showcasing its significant potential in future embodied intelligence applications.",

    "abstract": "Vision based robot manipulation uses cameras to capture one or more images of a scene containing the objects to be manipulated. Taking multiple images can help if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another viewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable positions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always be possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can produce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the time-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene representations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate photorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this work, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can provide additional context in generating grasp poses. Our experiments on the Graspnet-1billion dataset show that novel views contributed force-closure grasps in addition to the force-closure grasps obtained from sparsely sampled real views while also improving grasp coverage. In the future we hope this work can be extended to improve grasp extraction from radiance fields constructed with a single input image, using for example diffusion models or generalizable radiance fields.",

We present a novel framework for building temporal digital twins of plants by combining 3D Gaussian Splatting with a robust sample alignment pipeline. Our method begins by reconstructing Gaussian Splats from multi-view camera data, then leverages a two-stage registration approach: coarse alignment through feature-based matching and Fast Global Registration, followed by fine alignment with Iterative Closest Point. This pipeline yields a consistent 4D model of plant development in discrete time steps. We evaluate the approach on data from the Netherlands Plant Eco-phenotyping Center, demonstrating detailed temporal reconstructions of Sequoia and Quinoa species.

    "abstract": "Efficient scene representations are essential for many real-world applications, especially those involving spatial measurement. Although current NeRF-based methods have achieved impressive results in reconstructing building-scale scenes, they still suffer from slow training and inference speeds due to time-consuming stochastic sampling. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated excellent performance with its high-quality rendering and real-time speed, especially for objects and small-scale scenes. However, in outdoor scenes, its point-based explicit representation lacks an effective adjustment mechanism, and the millions of Gaussian points required often lead to memory constraints during training. To address these challenges, we propose EA-3DGS, a high-quality real-time rendering method designed for outdoor scenes. First, we introduce a mesh structure to regulate the initialization of Gaussian components by leveraging an adaptive tetrahedral mesh that partitions the grid and initializes Gaussian components on each face, effectively capturing geometric structures in low-texture regions. Second, we propose an efficient Gaussian pruning strategy that evaluates each 3D Gaussian's contribution to the view and prunes accordingly. To retain geometry-critical Gaussian points, we also present a structure-aware densification strategy that densifies Gaussian points in low-curvature regions. Additionally, we employ vector quantization for parameter quantization of Gaussian components, significantly reducing disk space requirements with only a minimal impact on rendering quality. Extensive experiments on 13 scenes, including eight from four public datasets (MatrixCity-Aerial, Mill-19, Tanks \\& Temples, WHU) and five self-collected scenes acquired through UAV photogrammetry measurement from SCUT-CA and plateau regions, further demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

Here, we present ControlGS, a 3DGS optimization method that achieves semantically meaningful and cross-scene consistent quantity-quality control. Through a single training run using a fixed setup and a user-specified hyperparameter reflecting quantity-quality preference, ControlGS can automatically find desirable quantity-quality trade-off points across diverse scenes, from compact objects to large outdoor scenes. It also outperforms baselines by achieving higher rendering quality with fewer Gaussians, and supports a broad adjustment range with stepless control over the trade-off.

Its versatility enables real-time applications, including on mobile and lower-powered devices. However, 3DGS faces key challenges in virtual reality (VR): (1) temporal artifacts, such as popping during head movements, (2) projection-based distortions that result in disturbing and view-inconsistent floaters, and (3) reduced framerates when rendering large numbers of Gaussians, falling below the critical threshold for VR. Compared to desktop environments, these issues are drastically amplified by large field-of-view, constant head movements, and high resolution of head-mounted displays (HMDs). In this work, we introduce VRSplat: we combine and extend several recent advancements in 3DGS to address challenges of VR holistically. We show how the ideas of Mini-Splatting, StopThePop, and Optimal Projection can complement each other, by modifying the individual techniques and core 3DGS rasterizer. Additionally, we propose an efficient foveated rasterizer that handles focus and peripheral areas in a single GPU launch, avoiding redundant computations and improving GPU utilization. Our method also incorporates a fine-tuning step that optimizes Gaussian parameters based on StopThePop depth evaluations and Optimal Projection. We validate our method through a controlled user study with 25 participants, showing a strong preference for VRSplat over other configurations of Mini-Splatting.

However, most representative methods require RGBD sensors and are only available for indoor environments. The robustness of reconstruction in large-scale outdoor scenarios remains unexplored. This paper introduces a large-scale 3DGS-based visual SLAM with stereo cameras, termed LSG-SLAM. The proposed LSG-SLAM employs a multi-modality strategy to estimate prior poses under large view changes. In tracking, we introduce feature-alignment warping constraints to alleviate the adverse effects of appearance similarity in rendering losses. For the scalability of large-scale scenarios, we introduce continuous Gaussian Splatting submaps to tackle unbounded scenes with limited memory. Loops are detected between GS submaps by place recognition and the relative pose between looped keyframes is optimized utilizing rendering and feature warping losses. After the global optimization of camera poses and Gaussian points, a structure refinement module enhances the reconstruction quality. With extensive evaluations on the EuRoc and KITTI datasets, LSG-SLAM achieves superior performance over existing Neural, 3DGS-based, and even traditional approaches.

Yet the prevailing data collection paradigm-human teleoperation-remains costly and constrained by manual effort and physical robot access. We introduce Real2Render2Real (R2R2R), a novel approach for generating robot training data without relying on object dynamics simulation or teleoperation of robot hardware. The input is a smartphone-captured scan of one or more objects and a single video of a human demonstration. R2R2R renders thousands of high visual fidelity robot-agnostic demonstrations by reconstructing detailed 3D object geometry and appearance, and tracking 6-DoF object motion. R2R2R uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to enable flexible asset generation and trajectory synthesis for both rigid and articulated objects, converting these representations to meshes to maintain compatibility with scalable rendering engines like IsaacLab but with collision modeling off. Robot demonstration data generated by R2R2R integrates directly with models that operate on robot proprioceptive states and image observations, such as vision-language-action models (VLA) and imitation learning policies. Physical experiments suggest that models trained on R2R2R data from a single human demonstration can match the performance of models trained on 150 human teleoperation demonstrations.

Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.",

By using RGB images, ExploreGS replaces traditional lidar-based point cloud acquisition process with a vision model, achieving a high-quality reconstruction at a lower cost. The framework integrates scene exploration and model reconstruction, and leverags a Bag-of-Words(BoW) model to enable real-time processing capabilities, therefore, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) training can be executed on-board.

    "abstract": "Learning navigation in dynamic open-world environments is an important yet challenging skill for robots. Most previous methods rely on precise localization and mapping or learn from expensive real-world demonstrations. In this paper, we propose the Navigation Diffusion Policy (NavDP), an end-to-end framework trained solely in simulation and can zero-shot transfer to different embodiments in diverse real-world environments. The key ingredient of NavDP's network is the combination of diffusion-based trajectory generation and a critic function for trajectory selection, which are conditioned on only local observation tokens encoded from a shared policy transformer. Given the privileged information of the global environment in simulation, we scale up the demonstrations of good quality to train the diffusion policy and formulate the critic value function targets with contrastive negative samples. Our demonstration generation approach achieves about 2,500 trajectories/GPU per day, 20$\\times$ more efficient than real-world data collection, and results in a large-scale navigation dataset with 363.2km trajectories across 1244 scenes. Trained with this simulation dataset, NavDP achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outstanding generalization capability on quadruped, wheeled, and humanoid robots in diverse indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, we present a preliminary attempt at using Gaussian Splatting to make in-domain real-to-sim fine-tuning to further bridge the sim-to-real gap. Experiments show that adding such real-to-sim data can improve the success rate by 30\\% without hurting its generalization capability.",

Leveraging the spatial information encoded in 3DGS, this work proposes FOCI (Field Overlap Collision Integral), an algorithm that is able to optimize trajectories directly on the Gaussians themselves. FOCI leverages a novel and interpretable collision formulation for 3DGS using the notion of the overlap integral between Gaussians. Contrary to other approaches, which represent the robot with conservative bounding boxes that underestimate the traversability of the environment, we propose to represent the environment and the robot as Gaussian Splats. This not only has desirable computational properties, but also allows for orientation-aware planning, allowing the robot to pass through very tight and narrow spaces. We extensively test our algorithm in both synthetic and real Gaussian Splats, showcasing that collision-free trajectories for the ANYmal legged robot that can be computed in a few seconds, even with hundreds of thousands of Gaussians making up the environment.

These capabilities offer substantial promise for transformative applications across various fields, including autonomous driving, robotics, aerial navigation, and immersive virtual reality. In this survey, we present the first comprehensive review exclusively dedicated to event-based 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches are systematically categorised based on input modality into stereo, monocular, and multimodal systems, and further classified according to reconstruction methodologies, including geometry-based techniques, deep learning approaches, and neural rendering techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Within each category, methods are chronologically organised to highlight the evolution of key concepts and advancements. Furthermore, we provide a detailed summary of publicly available datasets specifically suited to event-based reconstruction tasks. Finally, we discuss significant open challenges in dataset availability, standardised evaluation, effective representation, and dynamic scene reconstruction, outlining insightful directions for future research.

To address this limitation, we propose Anchor-Driven Deformable and Compressed Gaussian Splatting (ADC-GS), a compact and efficient representation for dynamic scene reconstruction. Specifically, ADC-GS organizes Gaussian primitives into an anchor-based structure within the canonical space, enhanced by a temporal significance-based anchor refinement strategy. To reduce deformation redundancy, ADC-GS introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine pipeline that captures motions at varying granularities. Moreover, a rate-distortion optimization is adopted to achieve an optimal balance between bitrate consumption and representation fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that ADC-GS outperforms the per-Gaussian deformation approaches in rendering speed by 300%-800% while achieving state-of-the-art storage efficiency without compromising rendering quality.

To address this, we introduce SLAG, a multi-GPU framework for language-augmented Gaussian splatting that enhances the speed and scalability of embedding large scenes. Our method integrates 2D visual-language model features into 3D scenes using SAM and CLIP. Unlike prior approaches, SLAG eliminates the need for a loss function to compute per-Gaussian language embeddings. Instead, it derives embeddings from 3D Gaussian scene parameters via a normalized weighted average, enabling highly parallelized scene encoding. Additionally, we introduce a vector database for efficient embedding storage and retrieval. Our experiments show that SLAG achieves an 18 times speedup in embedding computation on a 16-GPU setup compared to OpenGaussian, while preserving embedding quality on the ScanNet and LERF datasets.

Current datasets are usually limited to one part of the processing chain, hampering comprehensive UDTs validation.

Additionally, we explore downstream tasks demonstrating the potential of TUM2TWIN, including novel view synthesis of NeRF and Gaussian Splatting, solar potential analysis, point cloud semantic segmentation, and LoD3 building reconstruction.

Therefore, we propose Tensorized Underwater Gaussian Splatting (TUGS), which can effectively solve the modeling challenges of the complex interactions between object geometries and water media while achieving significant parameter reduction. TUGS employs lightweight tensorized higher-order Gaussians with a physics-based underwater Adaptive Medium Estimation (AME) module, enabling accurate simulation of both light attenuation and backscatter effects in underwater environments. Compared to other NeRF-based and GS-based methods designed for underwater, TUGS is able to render high-quality underwater images with faster rendering speeds and less memory usage.

Its explicit and discrete representation facilitates the seamless composition of complex digital worlds, offering significant advantages over previous neural implicit methods. However, when applied to large-scale compositions, such as crowd-level scenes, it can encompass numerous 3D Gaussians, posing substantial challenges for real-time rendering. To address this, inspired by Unreal Engine 5's Nanite system, we propose Virtualized 3D Gaussians (V3DG), a cluster-based LOD solution that constructs hierarchical 3D Gaussian clusters and dynamically selects only the necessary ones to accelerate rendering speed. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) Offline Build, where hierarchical clusters are generated using a local splatting method to minimize visual differences across granularities, and (2) Online Selection, where footprint evaluation determines perceptible clusters for efficient rasterization during rendering. We curate a dataset of synthetic and real-world scenes, including objects, trees, people, and buildings, each requiring 0.1 billion 3D Gaussians to capture fine details. Experiments show that our solution balances rendering efficiency and visual quality across user-defined tolerances, facilitating downstream interactive applications that compose extensive 3DGS assets for consistent rendering performance.",

    "abstract": "Sparse volumetric reconstruction and rendering via 3D Gaussian splatting have recently enabled animatable 3D head avatars that are rendered under arbitrary viewpoints with impressive photorealism. Today, such photoreal avatars are seen as a key component in emerging applications in telepresence, extended reality, and entertainment. Building a photoreal avatar requires estimating the complex non-rigid motion of different facial components as seen in input video images; due to inaccurate motion estimation, animatable models typically present a loss of fidelity and detail when compared to their non-animatable counterparts, built from an individual facial expression. Also, recent state-of-the-art models are often affected by memory limitations that reduce the number of 3D Gaussians used for modeling, leading to lower detail and quality. To address these problems, we present a new high-detail 3D head avatar model that improves upon the state of the art, largely increasing the number of 3D Gaussians and modeling quality for rendering at 4K resolution. Our high-quality model is reconstructed from multiview input video and builds on top of a mesh-based 3D morphable model, which provides a coarse deformation layer for the head. Photoreal appearance is modelled by 3D Gaussians embedded within the continuous UVD tangent space of this mesh, allowing for more effective densification where most needed. Additionally, these Gaussians are warped by a novel UVD deformation field to capture subtle, localized motion. Our key contribution is the novel deformable Gaussian encoding and overall fitting procedure that allows our head model to preserve appearance detail, while capturing facial motion and other transient high-frequency features such as skin wrinkling.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is widely used due to its safety, affordability, and real-time capabilities, but its 2D interpretation is highly operator-dependent, leading to variability and increased cognitive demand. 2D-to-3D reconstruction mitigates these challenges by providing standardized volumetric views, yet existing methods are often computationally expensive, memory-intensive, or incompatible with ultrasound physics. We introduce UltraGauss: the first ultrasound-specific Gaussian Splatting framework, extending view synthesis techniques to ultrasound wave propagation. Unlike conventional perspective-based splatting, UltraGauss models probe-plane intersections in 3D, aligning with acoustic image formation. We derive an efficient rasterization boundary formulation for GPU parallelization and introduce a numerically stable covariance parametrization, improving computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. On real clinical ultrasound data, UltraGauss achieves state-of-the-art reconstructions in 5 minutes, and reaching 0.99 SSIM within 20 minutes on a single GPU. A survey of expert clinicians confirms UltraGauss' reconstructions are the most realistic among competing methods. Our CUDA implementation will be released upon publication.",

Existing approaches based on volumetric rendering obtain promising results, but optimize on a per-scene basis, resulting in a slow optimization that can struggle to model under-observed or textureless regions. We introduce QuickSplat, which learns data-driven priors to generate dense initializations for 2D gaussian splatting optimization of large-scale indoor scenes. This provides a strong starting point for the reconstruction, which accelerates the convergence of the optimization and improves the geometry of flat wall structures. We further learn to jointly estimate the densification and update of the scene parameters during each iteration; our proposed densifier network predicts new Gaussians based on the rendering gradients of existing ones, removing the needs of heuristics for densification. Extensive experiments on large-scale indoor scene reconstruction demonstrate the superiority of our data-driven optimization. Concretely, we accelerate runtime by 8x, while decreasing depth errors by up to 48% in comparison to state of the art methods.",

By representing scenes as a mixture of Gaussian primitives, 3DGS leverages GPU rasterization pipelines for efficient rendering and reconstruction. To optimize scene coverage and capture fine details, 3DGS employs a densification algorithm to generate additional points. However, this process often leads to redundant point clouds, resulting in excessive memory usage, slower performance, and substantial storage demands - posing significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. To address this limitation, we propose a theoretical framework that demystifies and improves density control in 3DGS. Our analysis reveals that splitting is crucial for escaping saddle points. Through an optimization-theoretic approach, we establish the necessary conditions for densification, determine the minimal number of offspring Gaussians, identify the optimal parameter update direction, and provide an analytical solution for normalizing off-spring opacity. Building on these insights, we introduce SteepGS, incorporating steepest density control, a principled strategy that minimizes loss while maintaining a compact point cloud. SteepGS achieves a ~50% reduction in Gaussian points without compromising rendering quality, significantly enhancing both efficiency and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Creating high-quality animatable 3D human avatars from a single image remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to the inherent difficulty of reconstructing complete 3D information from a single viewpoint. Current approaches face a clear limitation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods produce high-quality results but require multiple views or video sequences, while video diffusion models can generate animations from single images but struggle with consistency and identity preservation. We present SVAD, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by leveraging complementary strengths of existing techniques. Our method generates synthetic training data through video diffusion, enhances it with identity preservation and image restoration modules, and utilizes this refined data to train 3DGS avatars. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that SVAD outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image methods in maintaining identity consistency and fine details across novel poses and viewpoints, while enabling real-time rendering capabilities. Through our data augmentation pipeline, we overcome the dependency on dense monocular or multi-view training data typically required by traditional 3DGS approaches. Extensive quantitative, qualitative comparisons show our method achieves superior performance across multiple metrics against baseline models. By effectively combining the generative power of diffusion models with both the high-quality results and rendering efficiency of 3DGS, our work establishes a new approach for high-fidelity avatar generation from a single image input.",

Quickly achieving high-fidelity dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single viewpoint is a significant challenge in computer vision. In C-ToF radiance field reconstruction, the property of interest-depth-is not directly measured, causing an additional challenge. This problem has a large and underappreciated impact upon the optimization when using a fast primitive-based scene representation like 3D Gaussian splatting, which is commonly used with multi-view data to produce satisfactory results and is brittle in its optimization otherwise. We incorporate two heuristics into the optimization to improve the accuracy of scene geometry represented by Gaussians.

The latest 3D Gaussian Splatting technique has achieved high quality novel view synthesis as well as fast rendering speed. However, 3D Gaussians lack proficiency in defining accurate 3D geometric structures despite their explicit primitive representations. This is due to the fact that Gaussian's attributes are primarily tailored and fine-tuned for rendering diverse 2D images by their anisotropic nature. To pave the way for efficient 3D reconstruction, we present Spherical Gaussians, a simple and effective representation for 3D geometric boundaries, from which we can directly reconstruct 3D feature curves from a set of calibrated multi-view images. Spherical Gaussians is optimized from grid initialization with a view-based rendering loss, where a 2D edge map is rendered at a specific view and then compared to the ground-truth edge map extracted from the corresponding image, without the need for any 3D guidance or supervision. Given Spherical Gaussians serve as intermedia for the robust edge representation, we further introduce a novel optimization-based algorithm called SGCR to directly extract accurate parametric curves from aligned Spherical Gaussians. We demonstrate that SGCR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D edge reconstruction while enjoying great efficiency.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) data compression is crucial for enabling efficient storage and transmission in 3D scene modeling. However, its development remains limited due to inadequate entropy models and suboptimal quantization strategies for both lossless and lossy compression scenarios, where existing methods have yet to 1) fully leverage hyperprior information to construct robust conditional entropy models, and 2) apply fine-grained, element-wise quantization strategies for improved compression granularity. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture of Priors (MoP) strategy to simultaneously address these two challenges. Specifically, inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, our MoP approach processes hyperprior information through multiple lightweight MLPs to generate diverse prior features, which are subsequently integrated into the MoP feature via a gating mechanism. To enhance lossless compression, the resulting MoP feature is utilized as a hyperprior to improve conditional entropy modeling. Meanwhile, for lossy compression, we employ the MoP feature as guidance information in an element-wise quantization procedure, leveraging a prior-guided Coarse-to-Fine Quantization (C2FQ) strategy with a predefined quantization step value. Specifically, we expand the quantization step value into a matrix and adaptively refine it from coarse to fine granularity, guided by the MoP feature, thereby obtaining a quantization step matrix that facilitates element-wise quantization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed 3DGS data compression framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including Mip-NeRF360, BungeeNeRF, DeepBlending, and Tank&Temples.",

The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enabled real-time, photorealistic NVS. Following this, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) leveraged perspective accurate 2D Gaussian primitive rasterization to achieve accurate geometry representation during rendering, improving 3D scene reconstruction while maintaining real-time performance. Recent approaches have tackled the problem of sparse real-time NVS using 3DGS within a generalizable, MVS-based learning framework to regress 3D Gaussian parameters. Our work extends this line of research by addressing the challenge of generalizable sparse 3D reconstruction and NVS jointly, and manages to perform successfully at both tasks. We propose an MVS-based learning pipeline that regresses 2DGS surface element parameters in a feed-forward fashion to perform 3D shape reconstruction and NVS from sparse-view images. We further show that our generalizable pipeline can benefit from preexisting foundational multi-view deep visual features. The resulting model attains the state-of-the-art results on the DTU sparse 3D reconstruction benchmark in terms of Chamfer distance to ground-truth, as-well as state-of-the-art NVS.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art approaches for conditional human body rendering via Gaussian splatting typically focus on simple body motions captured from many views. This is often in the context of dancing or walking. However, for more complex use cases, such as sign language, we care less about large body motion and more about subtle and complex motions of the hands and face. The problems of building high fidelity models are compounded by the complexity of capturing multi-view data of sign. The solution is to make better use of sequence data, ensuring that we can overcome the limited information from only a few views by exploiting temporal variability. Nevertheless, learning from sequence-level data requires extremely accurate and consistent model fitting to ensure that appearance is consistent across complex motions. We focus on how to achieve this, constraining mesh parameters to build an accurate Gaussian splatting framework from few views capable of modelling subtle human motion. We leverage regularization techniques on the Gaussian parameters to mitigate overfitting and rendering artifacts. Additionally, we propose a new adaptive control method to densify Gaussians and prune splat points on the mesh surface. To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we render novel sequences of sign language video, building on neural machine translation approaches to sign stitching. On benchmark datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance; and on highly articulated and complex sign language motion, we significantly outperform competing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Most existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression schemes focus on producing compact 3DGS representation via implicit data embedding. They have long coding times and highly customized data format, making it difficult for widespread deployment. This paper presents a new 3DGS compression framework called HybridGS, which takes advantage of both compact generation and standardized point cloud data encoding. HybridGS first generates compact and explicit 3DGS data. A dual-channel sparse representation is introduced to supervise the primitive position and feature bit depth. It then utilizes a canonical point cloud encoder to perform further data compression and form standard output bitstreams. A simple and effective rate control scheme is proposed to pivot the interpretable data compression scheme. At the current stage, HybridGS does not include any modules aimed at improving 3DGS quality during generation. But experiment results show that it still provides comparable reconstruction performance against state-of-the-art methods, with evidently higher encoding and decoding speed. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/HybridGS.",

    "abstract": "Underwater scene reconstruction is a critical tech-nology for underwater operations, enabling the generation of 3D models from images captured by underwater platforms. However, the quality of underwater images is often degraded due to medium interference, which limits the effectiveness of Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pose estimation, leading to subsequent reconstruction failures. Additionally, SfM methods typically operate at slower speeds, further hindering their applicability in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we introduce AquaGS, an SfM-free underwater scene reconstruction model based on the SeaThru algorithm, which facilitates rapid and accurate separation of scene details and medium features. Our approach initializes Gaussians by integrating state-of-the-art multi-view stereo (MVS) technology, employs implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for rendering translucent media and utilizes the latest explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to render object surfaces, which effectively addresses the limitations of traditional methods and accurately simulates underwater optical phenomena. Experimental results on the data set and the robot platform show that our model can complete high-precision reconstruction in 30 seconds with only 3 image inputs, significantly enhancing the practical application of the algorithm in robotic platforms.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel real-time framework for animatable human avatar reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS). By leveraging 2DGS and global SMPL pose parameters, our framework not only aligns positional and rotational discrepancies but also enables robust and natural pose-driven animation of the reconstructed avatars. Furthermore, we introduce a Rotation Compensation Network (RCN) that learns rotation residuals by integrating local geometric features with global pose parameters. This network significantly improves the handling of non-rigid deformations and ensures smooth, artifact-free pose transitions during animation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs realistic and highly animatable human avatars from monocular videos, effectively preserving fine-grained details while ensuring stable and natural pose variation. Our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and animation robustness on public benchmarks.",

To address this issue, we propose HoloTime, a framework that integrates video diffusion models to generate panoramic videos from a single prompt or reference image, along with a 360-degree 4D scene reconstruction method that seamlessly transforms the generated panoramic video into 4D assets, enabling a fully immersive 4D experience for users.

With this curated dataset, we propose Panoramic Animator, a two-stage image-to-video diffusion model that can convert panoramic images into high-quality panoramic videos. Following this, we present Panoramic Space-Time Reconstruction, which leverages a space-time depth estimation method to transform the generated panoramic videos into 4D point clouds, enabling the optimization of a holistic 4D Gaussian Splatting representation to reconstruct spatially and temporally consistent 4D scenes. To validate the efficacy of our method, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing approaches, revealing its superiority in both panoramic video generation and 4D scene reconstruction.

This paper presents the first systematic study of backdoor threats in 3DGS pipelines. We identify that adversaries may implant backdoor views to induce malicious scene confusion during inference, potentially leading to environmental misperception in autonomous navigation or spatial distortion in immersive environments. To uncover this risk, we propose GuassTrap, a novel poisoning attack method targeting 3DGS models. GuassTrap injects malicious views at specific attack viewpoints while preserving high-quality rendering in non-target views, ensuring minimal detectability and maximizing potential harm. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a three-stage pipeline (attack, stabilization, and normal training) to implant stealthy, viewpoint-consistent poisoned renderings in 3DGS, jointly optimizing attack efficacy and perceptual realism to expose security risks in 3D rendering. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GuassTrap can effectively embed imperceptible yet harmful backdoor views while maintaining high-quality rendering in normal views, validating its robustness, adaptability, and practical applicability.",

Visual quality is a critical aspect of 3D reconstruction. Recent advancements such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have notably enhanced the image rendering quality of reconstruction models. Nonetheless, the efficient and effective acquisition of input images for reconstruction-specifically, the selection of the most informative viewpoint-remains an open challenge, which is crucial for active reconstruction. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating geometric completeness and exploring unobserved or unknown regions, without direct evaluation of the visual uncertainty within the reconstruction model. To address this gap, this paper introduces a probabilistic model that quantifies visual uncertainty for each Gaussian. Leveraging Shannon Mutual Information, we formulate a criterion, Gaussian Splatting Shannon Mutual Information (GauSS-MI), for real-time assessment of visual mutual information from novel viewpoints, facilitating the selection of next best view. GauSS-MI is implemented within an active reconstruction system integrated with a view and motion planner. Extensive experiments across various simulated and real-world scenes showcase the superior visual quality and reconstruction efficiency performance of the proposed system.",

Recent work on reconstructing the 3D human body using 3DGS attempts to leverage prior information on human pose to enhance rendering quality and improve training speed. However, it struggles to effectively fit dynamic surface planes due to multi-view inconsistency and redundant Gaussians. This inconsistency arises because Gaussian ellipsoids cannot accurately represent the surfaces of dynamic objects, which hinders the rapid reconstruction of the dynamic human body. Meanwhile, the prevalence of redundant Gaussians means that the training time of these works is still not ideal for quickly fitting a dynamic human body. To address these, we propose EfficientHuman, a model that quickly accomplishes the dynamic reconstruction of the human body using Articulated 2D Gaussian while ensuring high rendering quality. The key innovation involves encoding Gaussian splats as Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels in canonical space and then transforming them to pose space via Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) to achieve efficient pose transformations. Unlike 3D Gaussians, Articulated 2D Gaussian surfels can quickly conform to the dynamic human body while ensuring view-consistent geometries. Additionally, we introduce a pose calibration module and an LBS optimization module to achieve precise fitting of dynamic human poses, enhancing the model's performance. Extensive experiments on the ZJU-MoCap dataset demonstrate that EfficientHuman achieves rapid 3D dynamic human reconstruction in less than a minute on average, which is 20 seconds faster than the current state-of-the-art method, while also reducing the number of redundant Gaussians.",

In this paper, we aim to provide an accessible solution for ordinary users to create their editable 3D avatars with precise region localization, geometric adaptability, and photorealistic renderings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a meticulously designed framework that decouples the editing process into local spatial adaptation and realistic appearance learning, utilizing a hybrid Tetrahedron-constrained Gaussian Splatting (TetGS) as the underlying representation. TetGS combines the controllable explicit structure of tetrahedral grids with the high-precision rendering capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting and is optimized in a progressive manner comprising three stages: 3D avatar instantiation from real-world monocular videos to provide accurate priors for TetGS initialization; localized spatial adaptation with explicitly partitioned tetrahedrons to guide the redistribution of Gaussian kernels; and geometry-based appearance generation with a coarse-to-fine activation strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach in generating photorealistic 3D editable avatars.",

First, the method uses 3DGS to render a synthetic RGBD image at some initial pose estimate. Second, it establishes 2D-2D correspondences between the query image and this synthetic image. Third, it uses the depth map to lift the 2D-2D correspondences to 2D-3D correspondences and solves a perspective-n-point (PnP) problem to produce a final pose estimate. Results from evaluation across three existing datasets with 38 scenes and over 2,700 test images show that our method significantly reduces both inference time (by over two orders of magnitude, from more than 10 seconds to as fast as 0.1 seconds) and estimation error compared to baseline methods that use photometric loss minimization. Results also show that our method tolerates large errors in the initial pose estimate of up to 55{\\deg} in rotation and 1.1 units in translation (normalized by scene scale), achieving final pose errors of less than 5{\\deg} in rotation and 0.05 units in translation on 90% of images from the Synthetic NeRF and Mip-NeRF360 datasets and on 42% of images from the more challenging Tanks and Temples dataset.",

Previous methods relying on dense views struggle with extremely sparse Structure-from-Motion points for initialization. While learning-based Multi-view Stereo (MVS) provides dense 3D points, directly combining it with Gaussian Splatting leads to suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-view geometric optimization. We propose Sparse2DGS, an MVS-initialized Gaussian Splatting pipeline for complete and accurate reconstruction. Our key insight is to incorporate the geometric-prioritized enhancement schemes, allowing for direct and robust geometric learning under ill-posed conditions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping).

We identify the primary issue behind these low-quality renderings as a visibility mismatch between geometry and appearance, stemming from using these two modalities together. To address this problem, we present CE-NPBG, a new approach for novel view synthesis (NVS) in large-scale autonomous driving scenes. Our method is a neural point-based technique that leverages two modalities: posed images (cameras) and synchronized raw 3D point clouds (LiDAR). We first employ a connectivity relationship graph between appearance and geometry, which retrieves points from a large 3D point cloud map observed from the current camera perspective and uses them for rendering. By leveraging this connectivity, our method significantly improves rendering quality and enhances run-time and scalability by using only a small subset of points from the large 3D point cloud map. Our approach associates neural descriptors with the points and uses them to synthesize views. To enhance the encoding of these descriptors and elevate rendering quality, we propose a joint adversarial and point rasterization training. During training, we pair an image-synthesizer network with a multi-resolution discriminator. At inference, we decouple them and use the image-synthesizer to generate novel views. We also integrate our proposal into the recent 3D Gaussian Splatting work to highlight its benefits for improved rendering and scalability.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: renderability field-guided gaussian splatting (RF-GS). This method quantifies input inhomogeneity through a renderability field, guiding pseudo-view sampling to enhanced visual consistency. To ensure the quality of wide-baseline pseudo-views, we train an image restoration model to map point projections to visible-light styles. Additionally, our validated hybrid data optimization strategy effectively fuses information of pseudo-view angles and source view textures.

In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.",

Nonetheless, specular reflection and refraction continue to pose significant challenges due to the instability and incorrect overfitting of radiance fields to high-frequency light variations. Currently, even 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), as a powerful and efficient tool, falls short in recovering transparent objects with nearby contents due to the existence of apparent secondary ray effects. To address this issue, we propose TransparentGS, a fast inverse rendering pipeline for transparent objects based on 3D-GS. The main contributions are three-fold. Firstly, an efficient representation of transparent objects, transparent Gaussian primitives, is designed to enable specular refraction through a deferred refraction strategy. Secondly, we leverage Gaussian light field probes (GaussProbe) to encode both ambient light and nearby contents in a unified framework. Thirdly, a depth-based iterative probes query (IterQuery) algorithm is proposed to reduce the parallax errors in our probe-based framework. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our approach in recovering transparent objects from complex environments, as well as several applications in computer graphics and vision.",

However, rendering large-scale volumes demands powerful GPUs and high-speed memory access for real-time performance. While existing novel view synthesis (NVS) methods offer faster rendering speeds with lower hardware requirements, the visible parts of a reconstructed scene are fixed and constrained by preset TF settings, significantly limiting user exploration. This paper introduces inverse volume rendering via Gaussian splatting (iVR-GS), an innovative NVS method that reduces the rendering cost while enabling scene editing for interactive volume exploration. Specifically, we compose multiple iVR-GS models associated with basic TFs covering disjoint visible parts to make the entire volumetric scene visible. Each basic model contains a collection of 3D editable Gaussians, where each Gaussian is a 3D spatial point that supports real-time scene rendering and editing. We demonstrate the superior reconstruction quality and composability of iVR-GS against other NVS solutions (Plenoxels, CCNeRF, and base 3DGS) on various volume datasets.

    "abstract": "Recently, photo-realistic novel view synthesis from multi-view images, such as neural radiance field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have garnered widespread attention due to their superior performance. However, most works rely on low dynamic range (LDR) images, which limits the capturing of richer scene details. Some prior works have focused on high dynamic range (HDR) scene reconstruction, typically require capturing of multi-view sharp images with different exposure times at fixed camera positions during exposure times, which is time-consuming and challenging in practice. For a more flexible data acquisition, we propose a one-stage method: \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} to easily and robustly reconstruct the 3D HDR scene from casually captured videos with auto-exposure enabled, even in the presence of severe motion blur and varying unknown exposure time. \\textbf{CasualHDRSplat} contains a unified differentiable physical imaging model which first applies continuous-time trajectory constraint to imaging process so that we can jointly optimize exposure time, camera response function (CRF), camera poses, and sharp 3D HDR scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness and rendering quality.

This ensures both the physical plausibility of object placement and highly accurate 3D pose and position annotations.   Our experiments demonstrate that even by integrating a limited number of external 3D objects into real scenes, the augmented data significantly enhances 3D object detection performance and outperforms existing diffusion-based 3D augmentation for object detection. Extensive testing on the nuScenes dataset reveals that imposing high geometric diversity in object placement has a greater impact compared to the appearance diversity of objects. Additionally, we show that generating hard examples, either by maximizing detection loss or imposing high visual occlusion in camera images, does not lead to more efficient 3D data augmentation for camera-based 3D object detection in autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking) constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations. Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins, facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.",

In this work, we propose ToF-Splatting, the first 3D Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM pipeline tailored for using effectively very sparse ToF input data. Our approach improves upon the state of the art by introducing a multi-frame integration module, which produces dense depth maps by merging cues from extremely sparse ToF depth, monocular color, and multi-view geometry.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful and efficient 3D representation for novel view synthesis. This paper extends 3DGS capabilities to inpainting, where masked objects in a scene are replaced with new contents that blend seamlessly with the surroundings. Unlike 2D image inpainting, 3D Gaussian inpainting (3DGI) is challenging in effectively leveraging complementary visual and semantic cues from multiple input views, as occluded areas in one view may be visible in others. To address this, we propose a method that measures the visibility uncertainties of 3D points across different input views and uses them to guide 3DGI in utilizing complementary visual cues. We also employ uncertainties to learn a semantic concept of scene without the masked object and use a diffusion model to fill masked objects in input images based on the learned concept. Finally, we build a novel 3DGI framework, VISTA, by integrating VISibility-uncerTainty-guided 3DGI with scene conceptuAl learning. VISTA generates high-quality 3DGS models capable of synthesizing artifact-free and naturally inpainted novel views. Furthermore, our approach extends to handling dynamic distractors arising from temporal object changes, enhancing its versatility in diverse scene reconstruction scenarios. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art techniques using two challenging datasets: the SPIn-NeRF dataset, featuring 10 diverse static 3D inpainting scenes, and an underwater 3D inpainting dataset derived from UTB180, including fast-moving fish as inpainting targets.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic videos with small baseline motions are ubiquitous in daily life, especially on social media. However, these videos present a challenge to existing pose estimation frameworks due to ambiguous features, drift accumulation, and insufficient triangulation constraints. Gaussian splatting, which maintains an explicit representation for scenes, provides a reliable novel view rasterization when the viewpoint change is small. Inspired by this, we propose SmallGS, a camera pose estimation framework that is specifically designed for small-baseline videos. SmallGS optimizes sequential camera poses using Gaussian splatting, which reconstructs the scene from the first frame in each video segment to provide a stable reference for the rest. The temporal consistency of Gaussian splatting within limited viewpoint differences reduced the requirement of sufficient depth variations in traditional camera pose estimation. We further incorporate pretrained robust visual features, e.g. DINOv2, into Gaussian splatting, where high-dimensional feature map rendering enhances the robustness of camera pose estimation. By freezing the Gaussian splatting and optimizing camera viewpoints based on rasterized features, SmallGS effectively learns camera poses without requiring explicit feature correspondences or strong parallax motion. We verify the effectiveness of SmallGS in small-baseline videos in TUM-Dynamics sequences, which achieves impressive accuracy in camera pose estimation compared to MonST3R and DORID-SLAM for small-baseline videos in dynamic scenes.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excels in photorealistic scene reconstruction but struggles with stylized scenarios (e.g., cartoons, games) due to fragmented textures, semantic misalignment, and limited adaptability to abstract aesthetics. We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

Central to our approach is the application of Gaussian splatting, a technique that abstracts the manipulable scene into a VR environment, thereby enabling more intuitive and immersive interactions. Users can navigate and manipulate within the virtual scene as if interacting with a real robot, enhancing both the engagement and efficacy of teleoperation tasks. An extensive user study validates our approach, demonstrating significant usability and efficiency improvements. Two-thirds (66%) of participants completed tasks faster, achieving an average time reduction of 43%. Additionally, 93% preferred the Gaussian Splat interface overall, with unanimous (100%) recommendations for future use, highlighting improvements in precision, responsiveness, and situational awareness.

While recent approaches address motion-blurred inputs for NVS, they primarily focus on static scene reconstruction and lack dedicated motion modeling for dynamic objects. To overcome these limitations, our MoBGS introduces a novel Blur-adaptive Latent Camera Estimation (BLCE) method for effective latent camera trajectory estimation, improving global camera motion deblurring. In addition, we propose a physically-inspired Latent Camera-induced Exposure Estimation (LCEE) method to ensure consistent deblurring of both global camera and local object motion. Our MoBGS framework ensures the temporal consistency of unseen latent timestamps and robust motion decomposition of static and dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world blurry videos show that our MoBGS significantly outperforms the very recent advanced methods (DyBluRF and Deblur4DGS), achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic NVS under motion blur.",

    "abstract": "Spine surgery is a high-risk intervention demanding precise execution, often supported by image-based navigation systems. Recently, supervised learning approaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from sparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on radiation-intensive 3D imaging systems. However, these methods typically require large amounts of annotated training data and may struggle to generalize across varying patient anatomies or imaging conditions. Instance-learning approaches like Gaussian splatting could offer an alternative by avoiding extensive annotation requirements. While Gaussian splatting has shown promise for novel view synthesis, its application to sparse, arbitrarily posed real intraoperative X-rays has remained largely unexplored. This work addresses this limitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct anatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We introduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing reconstruction quality. Notably, our framework requires no pretraining, making it inherently adaptable to new patients and anatomies. We evaluated our approach using an ex-vivo dataset. Expert surgical evaluation confirmed the clinical utility of the 3D reconstructions for navigation, especially when using 20 to 30 views, and highlighted the standardization's benefit for anatomical clarity. Benchmarking via quantitative 2D metrics (PSNR/SSIM) confirmed performance trade-offs compared to idealized settings, but also validated the improvement gained from standardization over raw inputs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of instance-based volumetric reconstruction from arbitrary sparse-view X-rays, advancing intraoperative 3D imaging for surgical navigation.",

Although these methods have made considerable advancements, they still show significant issues with overfitting. To reduce the overfitting, we introduce VGNC, a novel Validation-guided Gaussian Number Control (VGNC) approach based on generative novel view synthesis (NVS) models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to alleviate the overfitting issue of sparse-view 3DGS with generative validation images. Specifically, we first introduce a validation image generation method based on a generative NVS model. We then propose a Gaussian number control strategy that utilizes generated validation images to determine the optimal Gaussian numbers, thereby reducing the issue of overfitting. We conducted detailed experiments on various sparse-view 3DGS baselines and datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of VGNC. Extensive experiments show that our approach not only reduces overfitting but also improves rendering quality on the test set while decreasing the number of Gaussian points. This reduction lowers storage demands and accelerates both training and rendering. The code will be released.",

Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.",

While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework. SEGA seamlessly combines priors derived from large-scale 2D datasets with 3D priors learned from multi-view, multi-expression, and multi-ID data, achieving robust generalization to unseen identities while ensuring 3D consistency across novel viewpoints and expressions. We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering. Additionally, SEGA performs person-specific fine-tuning to further enhance the fidelity and realism of the generated avatars.

It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.",

    "abstract": "Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore an open research problem concerning the reconstruction of 3D scenes from images. Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process. However, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred multiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2) the tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes epipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we integrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance initial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning module to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial coordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on indoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.",

    "abstract": "While HPC resources are increasingly being used to produce adaptively refined or unstructured volume datasets, current research in applying machine learning-based representation to visualization has largely ignored this type of data. To address this, we introduce Volume Encoding Gaussians (VEG), a novel 3D Gaussian-based representation for scientific volume visualization focused on unstructured volumes. Unlike prior 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods that store view-dependent color and opacity for each Gaussian, VEG decouple the visual appearance from the data representation by encoding only scalar values, enabling transfer-function-agnostic rendering of 3DGS models for interactive scientific visualization. VEG are directly initialized from volume datasets, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion pipelines like COLMAP. To ensure complete scalar field coverage, we introduce an opacity-guided training strategy, using differentiable rendering with multiple transfer functions to optimize our data representation. This allows VEG to preserve fine features across the full scalar range of a dataset while remaining independent of any specific transfer function. Each Gaussian is scaled and rotated to adapt to local geometry, allowing for efficient representation of unstructured meshes without storing mesh connectivity and while using far fewer primitives. Across a diverse set of data, VEG achieve high reconstruction quality, compress large volume datasets by up to 3600x, and support lightning-fast rendering on commodity GPUs, enabling interactive visualization of large-scale structured and unstructured volumes.",

    "abstract": "Visuomotor policies learned from teleoperated demonstrations face challenges such as lengthy data collection, high costs, and limited data diversity. Existing approaches address these issues by augmenting image observations in RGB space or employing Real-to-Sim-to-Real pipelines based on physical simulators. However, the former is constrained to 2D data augmentation, while the latter suffers from imprecise physical simulation caused by inaccurate geometric reconstruction. This paper introduces RoboSplat, a novel method that generates diverse, visually realistic demonstrations by directly manipulating 3D Gaussians. Specifically, we reconstruct the scene through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), directly edit the reconstructed scene, and augment data across six types of generalization with five techniques: 3D Gaussian replacement for varying object types, scene appearance, and robot embodiments; equivariant transformations for different object poses; visual attribute editing for various lighting conditions; novel view synthesis for new camera perspectives; and 3D content generation for diverse object types. Comprehensive real-world experiments demonstrate that RoboSplat significantly enhances the generalization of visuomotor policies under diverse disturbances. Notably, while policies trained on hundreds of real-world demonstrations with additional 2D data augmentation achieve an average success rate of 57.2%, RoboSplat attains 87.8% in one-shot settings across six types of generalization in the real world.",
